I"s<h1 id="description">Description</h1>

<p>This game will comprise of several modes such as free roam or building. Tons
of features will be added with time such as AIs, Vehicles (car, plane),
tons of physics effects (explosions), etc… Customization and fancy menus
will be a big focus for this game too.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, anyone can test existing features in the open beta state the game
is in. For now, only a character is present and the player can test controls
in the first/third person modes. Look out for weird bugs, improvements or what
doesn’t seem to be smooth enough.</p>
