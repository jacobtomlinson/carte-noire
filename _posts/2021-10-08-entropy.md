Here there is no water, only ice. And the plants have frozen dead. And the sound of chirps or love and laughter hang like steam in the air.

<br>
The sun has since expired; red no longer, puffed off its outer layers—it's, too, cooled and hums somber from its own collapse… vestigial, its own elegy.

<br>
Do you remember when it was larger than the sky—dear sun, a remnant of warmth—of course you don't, of course you don't remember, because time has left with the heat, and when all is cold then nothing stirs, and when nothing stirs then nothing changes, and when nothing changes time dissolves and our memories do too: our words that we spoke into empty air, circling until they froze into ice as well.

<br>
So the atmosphere is gone, warmth escaped, and the cold has spread throughout. And the mountains are larger with ice lining the hills. And the valleys are frozen through. And the air is too dense for rain to fall, so clouds hang over forever. And nothing moves as nothing should, as everything is where it was going to be.

<br>
And all is cold and distributed. And entropy has won.
