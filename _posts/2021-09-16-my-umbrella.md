I was on a dark beach when I threw my umbrella.

<br>
The town was remnants; as I walked, I felt only my body. As I thrived now, so did this town years ago, when the oil was plenty and the water was clean. As this town was dead now, so too would I become a shell; rather, my body would be the shell, and I’d be gone, like the souls here who had since departed.

And when I got to the cold, cloudy beach, it had begun to rain. I ran to my car—in what would have been an embarrassing manner if anyone was there to see me—and sought shelter in its roof. I contemplated returning to the hostel. The sun had set, though I had missed it for the clouds. Then I grabbed my umbrella and ran to the shore.

The waves were strong but polite. I knew they could break me if they wanted. They withheld. The rain did too. Yet even with my umbrella—red-violet like the sun I couldn’t see—I still got wet. I scowled, I walked, then scowled again. Everything was wet. My feet sunk into the sand like it was fertile soil. My nose dripped with rogue raindrops that felt and tasted like tears. The rocks on the beach were barely visible, but beautiful. I saw an island between me and the horizon. It contained a tiny shore that bowed to a mountain. It could be swam to; it could be climbed. Perhaps it was, years ago.

I looked back towards my car and saw only my footsteps in the sand. I held my umbrella close, and for a second I felt no rain. The sky held back and I thought I saw the moon. I began to feel empty, hiding in the cylindrical vacuum beneath my umbrella, like I lived in a dry bubble. Then the rain continued, but it was a drizzle—empty, like this town had become; empty, like my body would be soon; empty, like I felt untouched under my umbrella. But I was still wet. And I was still scowling.

<br>
I threw it on the ground. I felt the rain on my skin, under my shirt and into my pants. I jumped into the ocean. I was not wet because I was not dry. I was full and alive, while I was.
