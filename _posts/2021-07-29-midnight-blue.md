these railroad tracks

checkered our hearts

then sewed in a quilt

the stars up above

in this red car

fruits hang from the lights

but dimmer than the stars

when your hands bleed warm water

can the satellites see our face

the sirens are jealous

when our heart’s out at sea

the moonlight won't stop

inhaling our seed

the world we had made

it soon did collapse

in the dream that i had

that night you’d have left

don't say come or go

you're not separate from me

our roof hasn't caved

but the engine’s ice cold

the lights do not guide

but they watch our skin dry

my mind falls apart

we're deep in quicksand

the sun is blue now

my tears are pitch black

your eyes are unsure

the gravel is tough

my tires will pop

or the transmission will blow

just don't tell me you'll walk

because in this red car

hung lights are askew

red lights warm your cheek

i said our eyes don't need sight

my nose will find yours

in a dark sky, it's cracked

the world under hung low

my phone’s going off

the grass finds wind alone

so the clouds won't forget

even when we'd have died

they'll shape into us

under stars or blue light

in this freezing red car

with you my whole heart—
