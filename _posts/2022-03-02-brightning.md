**brightning**, lightning, faux. my fighting, frightening, mom. she finds, in home, a place undead, and can't escape until they've left. so static, phatic, so stumped. finding, winding, in one. (that's love.)

it bloomed, today! and itâ€™s fade away. dropping, go now. go and squeeze it out. my father said, don't hit your head, when you climb the stairs. (don't tell me why, i love my life, and that will never change.)
