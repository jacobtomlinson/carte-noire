Love you’ve left my chest

Then kept it such since severed

Sun withheld again

For clouds to come together

<br>
Memories undress

Our first and last endeavors

Ever further yet

I still remain untethered

<br>
August marks the end

As distance swells in measure

Bodies may forget

But time will reremember

<br>
I no longer fear

The sharp grasp of November

If I loved you once

I’ve loved you for forever—
