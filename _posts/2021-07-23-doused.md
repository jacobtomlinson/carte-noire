i was doused in your legs

theyâ€™d coat me like paint

chapped lips were unzipped

our arms misentangled

<br>
doused in bright flames

my skin peeled like bark

to find redwoods mending

our surfaces cleansing

<br>
dousing sweet magma

smooth and untouched

cooled into rock: shells

formed round my heart

<br>
ive thrown love away

dead ash in warm wind

great deltas find rain

now douse me in change
