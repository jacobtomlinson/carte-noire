Recently, on a whim, I decided to give [Sketch](http://www.sketchapp.com) a try. According to their website,

> Sketch gives you the power, flexibility and speed you always wanted in a lightweight and easy-to-use package. Finally you can focus on what you do best: Design.

I was intrigued. I am a passionate app developer. But also a *hobbyist*. No matter how well versed you are with the [Material Design Specification](https://material.google.com), your side apps simply cannot match the *finesse* and polish of a professionally designed app.
And Photoshop is a mammoth. It has a steep learning curve. I have tried and failed several times in the past at trying to learn it.

The moment I fired up Sketch, I could feel how lightweight and agile it was. No slew of tiny controls on both sides of the screen.
No giant lists of menu bar options. And also not a lot of confusing terminologies to remember.

In the first couple of days I was able to come out with a bunch of good looking stuff. So here goes.
