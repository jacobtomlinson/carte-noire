### Rancher

So far I like [rancher][1].

It has a real shiny gui that gives warm and fuzzies to novice kubernetes pilots  like myself.

But when trying to install stackstorm-ha on my new pi-bernetes cluster; I found
I was missing some `chart repositories` for a couple of dependancies:
```
- mongodb
- rabbitmq
- external-dns
```

After spending a few minutes wracking my head around it


## TL;DR: don't add by git repo, add by helm index
1. Navigate to "Apps & Marketplace" of "Cluster Manager"
2. Navigate to "Chart repositories"
3. Click 'create'
4. DO NOT select 'Git repository', leave "target" as
"http(s) URL to an index generated by Helm"
5. Use Index URL of https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
6. A winner is you!
