All rodents are special in that they do not have 8 A.M. meetings to wake up to. In fact, most do not have meetings at all. Nor do they have an “8 A.M.” They do, however, wake up. They wake up and spend their meeting-less days looking for food, having sex, and chirping at each other. However, the more sentimental ones will get together to watch the way their shit disintegrates under light rain. This behavior of watching shit is especially present in the brammell-pacifica rodent, which also has an extra advantage in the spectator sport of shit-watching because they live near beaches and shit every day in wet sand. This is the closest thing any rodent has to meetings—getting together in the evening, shitting together, watching the waves eat their shit under a setting sun that is tired of their redundancy, wishing for something to change.

The sun is in luck. Something is changing. The coast has been flooding intensely. Warmer temperatures cause pockets of cooling water vapor in the air to become unstable, lifting clouds with heat, causing dense, chaotic storms that drown out the sand, the shit, and some rodents too.

The rodents think they are unlucky. Week after week, tropical storms flood their homes, swallowing their shit with their elderly that are too weak to outpace the crashing waves. They wait for normality as their habitat changes; the sun—often blocked by angry clouds—watches the empty shore, waiting, almost missing the rodents it once disregarded. The rodents wait. The rodents die.

Soon the brammell-pacifica rodent will be extinct. They perish one by one, wishing to see once again the tired sun reflecting off their shit as the waves swallow it—instead they see heavy rain, clouds, and floods, not granted even the mercy of seeing their home again before they leave.
