my lamp is floating

my room here in durham

and my cat keeps asking for food

<br>
so mom said her chair might look nicer next to the door

last night, i was moving the couch

the window shined and the moon waved

i knew the trees were watching me

the dirt asked if i was better alone

<br>
my stomach’s digesting pity

i find it tough and hard to break down

is this a life? i dunno

dad can’t connect to his sons

my brother’s hair has grown too long

<br>
and my mind floats away

like can we say the sun’s on fire?

quora says nuclear fusion isn’t burning

fuck off, anyway

we’ll agree to disagree

<br>
such hubris, being twenty four

god im lonely every day

emptiness brims potential

warmth—mundane—suffocating—

praying—eating—fighting—

watching—driving—

fighting—smiling—

<br>
i’m sick of breathing oxygen

my home is in the stars

where the sun’s rays can

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pierce through my lungs
