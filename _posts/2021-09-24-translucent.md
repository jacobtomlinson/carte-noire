It must have been a sign that they appeared that Wednesday afternoon. Their lights were a translucent green, and I first saw them in the panels above my closet. I got a stool and opened the cupboard and the whole space was shining bright green. The space was large and deep and the light seemed to be coming from everywhere at once; it was an entity, I knew. Because when I peeked inside, the green became dark, as if sensing me, then I stared, and it warmed up to me, settling on a pleasant turquoise. Then I closed the cupboard doors and went to sleep

The next day, their colors were blue, and the day after, it was green again. Then red, then black, then on Monday it was gone. But it came back. I charted the colors every day. After a month, there was still no predictable pattern. They had emotions. Sometimes they would disappear for days on end. But they always came back. I wondered what journeys they took.

I kept the cupboard doors open, so every time I was home I could greet them—and they would greet me back, flickering the colors once or twice before settling into their color of expression that day.

Soon, it spread. First my desk started to glow when my warm hand was upon it. Then the floor when I walked barefoot. Then my bed, my water bottle, my stove, my couch, and my mirror too. As they spread, the colors became expansive. Orange from the desk mixed with dark purple—like the color of eggplant—and burnt yellow and the color of the sky. All was light and my head was hurting, but it was some kind of embrace. It was loving me, and I sat on my bed for hours on end and loved it back. I slept in the lights. I bathed with them. They never let me go.
