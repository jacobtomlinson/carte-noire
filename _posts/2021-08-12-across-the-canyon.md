I started writing

to you. Letters

and poems and

stories you'd like.

You never read them.

I never sent them.

You were far across

a chasm but I still

wrote to remember,

For that day we'd

meet again; and I'd say

*Look at all I've done while you were gone.*

*Look at what Iâ€™ve said when I couldn't say this.*

It still hasn't come.

The chasm is larger and

I can see

into the canyon.

And I can't see you

on the other side

anymore.

So now I write

not to you

but for you.

And maybe,

across the canyon,

you write for me too.
