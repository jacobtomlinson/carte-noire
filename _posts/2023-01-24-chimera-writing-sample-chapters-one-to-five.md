## Part One: The Heart

### 1

Ammi has ghosted me, I don’t know what I’ve done. Maybe two years and nine months was finally enough. Two years and nine months of Samia; I stopped going home. Then her father came to campus. This was just two months ago. And Samia had a midterm, so I showed him around Franklin Street alone. I told him about Chapel Hill, how the planetarium was the first in the south, and the fire trucks are Carolina blue. We got Ben & Jerry’s and sat on the quad. I might have loved him. I could provide, explain things to him—he listened to me. He let me pay for the ice cream. So I began to miss my own father, really the first time I had. That’s when this all started, when I knew I was due home. I wanted to stay, maybe apply to jobs there. But Samia expected me to move to Charlotte with her and her folks. She refused to do long distance. It all got out of hand. She left me two weeks ago. Now I’m on this plane to Queens, catching glimpses of peninsular water and fields of warehouses from a tiny middle seat, wondering what could bring an estranged son of three years to move back home without warning, without even a response from my mom on WhatsApp when I sent her my itinerary.
This British man’s leaning over my lap. He’s showing his aisle seat girlfriend a meme on his phone, something he probably bought plane internet to load. I’m looking forward and pretending I’m not here. It seems to be working, because he hasn’t looked at me once.
That accent’s intolerable. It’s people like him who force-fed English to us. Yet the way we talk is grotesque, while theirs is elegant. Restrained. It’s only when you get up close to the flying saliva and off-yellow teeth that you’ll see they’re just like us. That anyone who speaks English is shallow, aggressive, the way the language concentrates in the mouth, the lips and tongue. But no one gets close to the English, not as close as we have, as I am currently. And no one knows how ugly English is because we all speak it by now.

I’m being dramatic again. If this guy just got off my chest I wouldn’t have to moralize. To be honest, it's mostly my fault—he had asked to switch seats after boarding. I was sitting in my middle seat when he walked up, looked at the row number over me, then back at his ticket, at me, back at his ticket, then back at me. “You keen on the window seat, or aisle?” he said, smirking, and I already wanted to deny him some joy.

Then I looked down at his fingers, caressing his girlfriend’s palm, and I know a Muslim man shouldn’t be saying this, but I wanted to crash the plane. So I said, “I’m good,” and leaned back in my seat.

“What?” his girlfriend said. She looked like she would call the cops.

“You could have booked it if you wanted it.”

They were grimacing now, like they weren’t the ones who tried to White a whole row to themselves.

“I like the middle seat,” I offered.

“Hm.”

I hated the middle seat. I had sworn never to sit in one again, after my last trip with Samia to Miami, returning on a cramped Spirit Airlines flight. Then I looked at tickets to New York after graduation weekend, and my principles conceded to money, as principles do. So I broke that promise to myself, right after I broke my promise to move to Charlotte with Samia, thinking I could combine the two into one.

“Well, alright then,” the woman said.

“Fucken fair enough.”

Justice always comes with a price. This time, it was a gray box at my feet that took up half of my legroom. It took only thirty minutes to regret my decision. But that’s the price I paid. Broken promises demand penance, whether that’s your girlfriend of two years breaking up with you, or accumulated leg pain. And besides, my parents used to do that trick too, with Laila and me. I would have done it with Samia if we were still together. That’s why I hated it so much. 
I get half a glare on the boarding bridge from British bro. For the heinous crime of cockblocking two hours of cuddling; I get it, man. I pull aside at the gate and let him pass me. I resist an intrusive urge to bow. I’m thinking now of Samia’s father, who had a British accent as well. Not a British-Indian accent, but a real British accent, I think he grew up in London. Maybe he met Samia’s mother there, while she was studying abroad in England, as white people do. I still never met her. Never will, I guess. I connect to the WiFi, but it makes me watch an ad first. Thanks, America.

<br>
The ad is for a credit card. An old white couple is painting beach landscapes, on the beach. The man is clearly impotent, I could tell from the set design. He’s wearing long, ugly cargo shorts, and keeps squinting so hard I wonder if he can see through his glasses at all. The two of them seem to be happy, despite the questionable quality of their work. Then, suddenly, the man drops his brush in the sand. He bends over to pick it up, but trips on the front leg of the easel and falls down. He gets a second before the easel falls forward on top of him. I fucking knew it was coming. The guy doesn’t look like he could be responsible for one egg. The woman laughs at the man, deservedly so. But when he peeks out from the easel, she leans over and kisses him, and they smile at each other affectionately. I’m sighing now. That’s unconditional love. The ad cuts to them buying a painting at a store. No foreign transaction fees, it says. Enjoy what matters most. (They don’t say what it is that matters most.) The ad closes. I’m reminded of my father, though he’s not impotent like that man is. It’s a specific memory of being with him on the beach in Karachi, I wasn’t yet ten years old, during the Basant Panchami festival in spring—a Punjabi holiday, yet we had left Punjab. “I thought you must see the beach,” he told me as he wrapped string around my kite, sitting down. “Even if they do not do Basant here.” The wind kept touching the dark waves of his hair, spreading it across his face. I hugged his neck from behind. I combed them away from his eyes. “The ocean connects Pakistan to the rest of the world. From here you can go to anywhere you want.” He groaned. “Aigh, don’t jump like that on my back, jaan. You’re bigger than you think.” I melted my weight into his shoulder. “I want to stay in Lahore,” I said, “I miss Amma now.” “Nonsense, Inzamam. You will be a self-sufficient young man soon.” He wrapped the string around and pulled it tight. “There. Now we can celebrate Basant.”

I ran with the kite on my string. I wanted to make my father proud. He smiled even as he grew smaller, walking towards me as I ran away. The kite floated like magic. I felt I was flying with it too. I imagined myself a bird, able to fly anywhere I wanted, just like my father said. But instead of Mumbai, Kashmir, Europe, Morocco, I flew back to Lahore, and perched myself on the window of our home, watching my mother sing along to Laila’s coos and gurgles.

Then I tasted sand. Everything had gone black. My neck was burning like it had been twisted, my chest felt like it would collapse into itself. I thought this might be death.

My father picked me up from my shoulders as light flooded through my cornea. The sand on my eyes absorbed my tears, hardening. He was laughing. “You looked like an ostrich, Inzamam,” he said, “Your head stuck in the sand like that.”

I sniffled. I wanted to cry into his shoulder. His laughter sounded like it was coming from all directions, I felt my ear drums vibrating with his vocal chords. “Come, jaan, let’s try again.” My eyes welled up. I needed to be held. “You are fine, Inzamam. Give me a smile, beta.” I breathed in, staggered, compressing my chest. I found a tired smile. I stood upright, all by myself. “That’s my Inzamam,” he said proudly. “Now come. Where is your kite?”

The string I held had wilted to the floor. It had been severed from the kite. I thought at that moment that the kite left me because I didn’t fly with it, away from Pakistan. I felt I’d sinned by wanting to stay home. And that if I stayed, my father, like the kite, would leave me here as well.

“There,” he said. He pointed behind us, far back to where we had started. The kite had returned to where it was first tied. “Let us bring it together before it is flying again.”

Without warning, he started running back to the kite, while I was still wiping sand from my eyes and hair. I didn’t want to be left behind, I sprinted to him, afraid I would fall again. He looked back at me and smiled. “Mashallah, jaan.” He chuckled. “You are almost faster than your Abah!” He ran faster. I pushed myself too. I didn’t understand then that he let me catch up. I was smiling so proudly, feeling the ocean mist grazing my face. Suddenly, my father began to laugh, boundlessly, without warning. I laughed with him too. I was flying again.

<br>
We didn’t celebrate Basant in America. Most of our friends in Jackson Heights were Bangladeshi, or Americanized Pakistanis, and besides, we didn’t bring our kites, or know where to get them. I asked my father one day, soon after we immigrated, why we didn’t celebrate anymore. He nodded and took me to the park, where we found a vendor selling parkthings outside. “You know, jaan,” he told me in Urdu as we looked at trinkets, toys, and snacks, “In Pakistan, they do not celebrate Basant anymore. It was banned by the government.” I thought he made this up, to justify us not playing. I said, “I think we’ll have to go somewhere else for kites, Abu, they don’t have them here.” He pulled a frisbee out from under stacked blankets. “Here. This will do.” Then he turned to the vendor. “Hello,” he said in English. “We would like to have one…” He looked up at him desperately. “One of the…” He turned to me, motioning to it in its hand. He seemed, at once, fragile, insecure. It was not like him. His eyes begged.

“A frisbee,” I said softly, “A frisbee.” “A frisbee,” he repeated. “One frisbee, please, sir.” We paid silently, and found an open field. We threw the frisbee back and forth, sometimes jogging to catch a rogue through, but never running the way we had run on Basant. Our throws became more accurate over time. Our legs moved less and less. I caught the frisbee. I wanted to run. Instead, I whispered to my hands, “Frisbee, frisbee, frisbee,” until the word had lost its meaning, and the frisbee was thrown back.

<br>
Notifications flood my phone as the wifi connects. Actually, it’s two emails, both sales for picture frames from Michael’s. I haven’t received any texts from Samia—though I’m embarrassed to expect any—and more importantly, my mother still hasn’t responded. I wonder what could be going on. Spam and forwards hog my WhatsApp. I scroll to my mother’s chat. At the bottom is my itinerary, to which she never responded. Above, our last exchange, two weeks ago, right before me and Samia broke up. I read it back again.

*Ramadan Mubarak, Inzamam jaan*

*ramadan mubarak mom!*

*Abu and Ammi and Laila miss you jaanu*

*miss you too amma. how are you feeling?*

*Alhamdolillah. Will you come for Eid Inshallah?*

*yeah i was thinking maybe after graduation*

*I am sorry we are not there for the graduation, Inzi beta*

*mom it’s fine you just had a surgery. are you feeling okay?*

*Alhamdolillah. How are you beta?*

*no like how did the surgery go?*

*Alhamdolillah*

*any pain?*

*Alhamdolillah, jaan*

*??*

*do they have you on any medication?*

*Just blood thinners, Alhamdolillah.*

*okay well how are abu and laila holding up?*

*Mashallah your Abu has learned to cook haleem.*

*wow*

*We would like you to be home at this time. Laila does not like Gabriel. Because Abu has bringing him to the grocery and not her. And I cannot take Laila to the park because I am recovering. She needs attention but she does not like to ask for it. She is going through an “emo” phase. It would be nice to have you around Inzi beta.*

*i see*

*i was thinking about staying home for some time, actually*

*Some  time?*

*like living there*

*wait, who’s gabriel?*

*He is staying in your room*

*?*

*uhh ok*

*so do u even have space then*

*He can stay in Laila’s room. And she can sleep with you then*

*i don’t wanna share a room with my sister, ammi*

*We can see when you are here. Maybe she can sleep in the living room. Or the kitchen.*

*nice, that’s better. ill let you know soon, ticket prices keep going up. i think ill come home after grad though*

*Sorry we are not there beta.*

*okay do you know what’s up with the phone service?*

*Your Abu is switching to Cricket Inshallah*

*cricket??? wtf*

*why was i not notified of this*

*Please do not curse Inzamam.*

*cricket??*

*It’s cheaper jaan. And same service as ATT. They use a proxy for the service from ATT. So they have the same coverage. But for less money because it is not ATT. Laila will be getting a phone for her birthday so then we will have a family plan for only one hundred a month Inshallah. And we can add a fifth phone for free. For your new brother :-)*

*BROITHER?*

*Just kidding jaan. But it’s a very good deal Alhamdolillah. LOL*

*can you just tell abu to tell me about this stuff first. i don’t have any service now. there’s campus wifi but it’s still annoying*

*I will give him that feedback beta. So you are coming then?*

*ill let you know. probably the 27th after i move out*

*Ok. Inshallah*

*ok*

*Ok*

*ill see you soon iA*

*Inshallah*

<br>
I wonder if Miguel is a family friend, or if my parents are renting out my bedroom to him for some spare cash. I scroll further down past my flight itinerary, sent four days ago with no response. *ammi*, I type after, *i just landed in LGA. hope everything’s okay.* My mom is the only one in my family I still talk to, and even she’s ignoring me now. It could be payback for the many things I did wrong: leaving home without a trace, staying away in the summers, not praying and fasting like I was told, but why now? Why her? My mother would never pass up access to her child. She would never miss a call. But when I call her, there’s no response. I even muster up the courage to text my father, then call him. Nothing again. I notice the messages I sent have one check mark next to them, when normally, there are two. I weigh my options, of which there are none, except continuing on. I have a right to return home. I head down the terminal.

Biden caught flak a few years ago for saying LaGuardia was like a third world country, and I canceled him for it, but he was right. The lights are flickering over me as I walk, and I pass a wall that doesn’t have wallpaper at all. I try to imagine what the bathrooms are like, then regret it. On my left, some guy is throwing up into the garbage can, while an officer pats his back and a third guy tries to sell him tissues. I make brief eye contact with the vomiter, I flash him a half-smile of sympathy, then continue to walk. He seems over it. I glance back a few minutes later, and the three musketeers are gone. Now it’s just a janitor taking out the trash, poor guy.

I’m at the baggage claim now, waiting for the belt to start, and I realize I really bashed on that British guy’s teeth on the plane. That was a little annoying—a little American—of me. When I first immigrated, I got bullied for my ugly teeth too. Bullied by the last people you’d think could have a standard for teeth. But it was an angle in, and I was new, so they took it. Well, I’ve since acquired white teeth. And now I’m oppressing British people for the same thing. But this was different, and I don’t know why, but it has something to do with reparations for colonialism.

The belt starts up. My bag is one of the first to arrive, even though I was one of the last people to get to the gate. That might make sense, actually. I can see the plane’s storage being represented as a stack. That means first in, last out, which means I’m mapping computer science concepts to real life again, and I need to stop. I pull my handle out and flush my brain. I pull the suitcase by its neck. This bag, my carry-on, and my backpack contain everything I have, except what's still at home. Samia took the rest. I’ve started anew, yet I’m returning somewhere—home, the place I spent my teenage years; but home, this time, is old. When we immigrated, it was my home that changed, from Lahore to Jackson Heights. This time it's me who’s new, who's changed this time.

I exit outside just in time to catch the Q70. It greets me like a loyal dog, middle doors at my feet. I step on. I put my suitcase on the rack. I sit. Nostalgia from the air enters the pores of my skin. I catch the pleasant scent of sweat—a humid bus breeze, or lack thereof; the air conditioner isn't on. I check my phone one last time before the WiFi leaves me forever, to no avail. Even if their phones glitched switching to Cricket, they must at least have access to WiFi to contact me. Did they just forget? Did everyone? The Q70 didn’t, at least. One only needs one.

I watch cars merging onto the BQE disappear into the night sky. The darkness spreads through my head until I dream of golden buses and cats and dogs.

<br>
The first thing I see when I wake up is some teenager running out through the middle doors. I look around. We must have arrived at 74th street. I rub my eyes and check my luggage on the rack. Still there, thank God. I start to get up, until I notice a cop at the front. I turn and there’s one at the back too. The bus driver closes the doors before anyone else gets off. The air becomes a vacuum. We’re trapped.

I lean over to the person across from me to ask what’s happening. “Cops, man,” he says. “They’re checking our tickets. Fuckers are everywhere these days.”

I nod and try to rest my hands on my lap like a normal person, but everything’s shaking now. I didn’t even consider that we needed a ticket. Years of living in New York had brainwashed me into thinking public transport was free—free, at least, if you board from the middle doors or jump the turnstile—and besides, these airport buses don’t even have a machine at the front. They’re asking for it. I must not have changed after all this time. I still shake in the face of authority, apparently, yet take transit illegally. The front cop’s started checking people’s tickets now, and he’s making good time. Guiness World’s Record for fastest ticket checker, for real. It’s all in the wrist. And the face you make to intimidate civilians into hurrying up.

“Why would I need my ID for the bus?” some person two rows in front of me says. He must not have gotten a receipt. The cop is writing something in his notebook. “A hundred dollars?” the person says. The entire row groans. The officer sighs, like he’s the one inconvenienced. “Could have been two seventy-five,” the cop says blandly, to no one in particular, before he moves on. He doesn’t seem to be enjoying this much. Maybe he’ll give up before getting to me.

“Ticket?” he says to a couple in front of me. They pull out two small pieces of paper, which the cop grunts at, then he promptly turns to me.

At this point I’ve found God again. I’ve prayed to him more times in this past minute than I have the last three years. My eyes are closed too. That was my body’s idea, playing dead like a deer hiding from a cougar. It’s in my DNA, if you go far enough down the evolutionary tree.

“Sir,” the cop says. I pretend not to hear. “Sir, I can see you shaking, please. Let’s go.”

I speed recite the first few ayats of Surah Yasin and open my eyes. “Sorry,” I say, and the cop shows me a face of pity, but I wanted guilt. I start to look in my pockets and backpack for the ticket. The cop is already writing in his notebook. “It’s right here,” I say weakly, which he ignores. I’m going to jail, I guess.

“Alright now. Let’s see your ID. I don’t have all day.”

Right. I forgot this guy was competing for a Guinness record.

“Just give me your ID, kid, let’s go.”

Kid? Am I still a kid, despite my bachelor’s degree? I got a full-ride, you know, Mr. Cop. Maybe I’ll ask to see his manager. Does he know who I am? I shouldn’t have shaved my beard. I’m still moving my hands around unconvincingly. Someone starts knocking on the bus window and yelling to let them in. The cop stops and glances back. My hands touch a paper attached to a piece of gum under my seat; I peel it. I display it to the cop like it’s a Yu-Gi-Oh card. He shrugs. He moves on.

I think this ticket from ten hours ago was sent by Allah Himself. And that Surah Yasin blocked the cop from reading the timestamp—I’m sure the judges will dock points for that oversight. I start to think, seriously, about religion, where it had gone in the last year or two, and all it took was a hundred dollar bribe. It’s not like I stopped believing, although I considered being an ex-Muslim activist for the money. I didn’t leave. I just forgot. I forgot what faith felt like, the same way I forgot the smell of cardamom, or what it was like to hear cars outside my window at night. My mother told me her faith was concentrated in the hour she had alone before dawn and after dusk. Everything else was motions, signaling. And as long as she had both, either, no one could take her faith from her, not even this country—and it tried. Me, my faith was in family, the masjid. I was called to Fajr and Maghrib, I didn’t go myself. God was something shared, something social. I left for college, I lost the language of the divine. Samia wasn’t religious. And Jummah wasn’t enough. Forgetting takes time; it doesn’t happen on its own, memories don’t leave, they are replaced. Perhaps she colored herself into my outlines. It could have been lack, before college, that kept me close to God. A need to be loved that kept me powerless, hence fragile, hence devout. In college, I found myself, and lost myself, all at once. The cops are done, I’m exiting the bus, finally. I’ve returned to Jackson Heights.

<br>
And the noise almost pops my eardrums, like I’d descended in altitude, if Jackson Heights is a city underground. This neighborhood was once white and middle class, but it’s since been resettled, repurposed by Latinos and South Asians. I can hear haggling and honking rising from the cracks in the sidewalk. I pass a rugged man across Roosevelt preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ. To a bunch of Bengalis. I doubt he’s had much luck.

The plaza looks the same as it always has. Sammy’s Halal on the street next to Kabab King, cell phone and jewelry stores, beauty salons. Something feels different, though. It’s like the voices have descended in pitch, or the air is almost foggy, faces morphing each time I look away. I walk up 74th, squeezing between crowds of brown people; I regret not walking the longer, quieter way around. I see my father but the face disappears in the crowd. My shoulder hits someone’s cheek, and I apologize, but they’re gone. Someone kicks my suitcase as they walk by. The voices and car engines and the 7 overhead join to become some twisted, angry white noise. The ground under me starts to raise, and my foot hits concrete, before I realize I’m walking up stairs to a narrow shopping mall between two cell phone stores; I turn back. I remember my mother and father taking me to this street to get my first cellphone at sixteen. My mother was beaming. My father had tears in his eyes. But me, I was just getting my due; I didn’t know why it meant so much to them. Now the memory has power. Maybe I understand it now. Or I just miss being with them, seeing Abu haggle with the storeowner while Ammi holds his hand. They look back at me, pointing to the phone, but before I can answer, someone pushes me back down the stairs—I trip, the weight of my bags barely keeping me upright.

The rain begins without warning and thins the crowd almost instantly, with no trace as to where they’ve gone. I duck under a storefront and look in my backpack for my umbrella, I feel alone suddenly. I may have adapted to New York already. The noise is suffocating, but sometimes comforting—ubiquitous—so its absence is sharp, it's uncanny. In my bag, I only find clothes, electronics, and leftover magnets Samia refused to take. My old hydroflask is gone from the side pocket, and I mourn it briefly. I got it years ago from a career development talk for computer science—it worked, apparently, because I figured if they could give out hydroflasks for free then maybe I should listen to them. And I liked my classes, but then hated my internships, the post-grad indecision bringing me back here. The hydroflask was like a magic trinket that kept me away from home. In the fall and winter, I was busy with recruiting, and my internships had too tight a schedule to return. Or so I told them. I stayed with or near Samia each summer: Raleigh, Charlottesville, and Richmond, in that order. Now I’ve come home without a job, without a clue, and now, without my hydroflask. I hope it’s doing well.

Down 74th, I pass Al Naimat, the sweet shop I used to go to after school. After Sagar, the restaurants disappear, as fast as they appeared when I stepped off the bus stop. At this point my hair is wet and I start to feel cold. My arms are tired from carrying my bags all this way. And I don’t even know if my family will be home, welcome me home, or if they’re just at Tarawih. My breaths are heavy, inhaling the humid air and rain. I smell something rotten, likely damp, expired garbage. I see a figure in the rain, something bending the light around it; it moves. I catch my mother’s perfume, briefly. My fatigue is getting to me. I press on. I dream.

My dream breaks for memory twenty minutes later, when I pass the deli near my home. *HALAL 24HRS*, it says on the side, but the sign is turned off, perhaps due to the rain. I pull on the door. It’s locked. I look inside and it’s dark. I push, it doesn’t budge. They used to be open till three, if this is the deli I’m thinking of—I snuck out, back then, not to party, but to come here, order a pastrami hero and Arizona iced green tea. I felt these urges, late at night, to be fed by someone, to feel food in my stomach that wasn’t mine. My parents couldn’t know. Especially not those last two years of high school, when our love was withheld, red tape around everything. So I went to Yaseen, he had the night shift, he made some mean pastrami. While he cooked, I talked to him, and while I ate, he talked to me. He knew everything I couldn’t tell my parents, everything I wanted them to know. That they were right, I wanted to leave the family, but not for the reasons they had thought. Cracks had been forming on their faces in my mind. It was like I peeled cellophane, slowly, from their skin, and what was left was fragile, and spongy, and raw. My father was not a father anymore, he was just a man. My mother, once everything, was just someone I knew and loved. It started after we immigrated, but took me years to recognize. My parents once held the keys to everything, but in this new country, they were lost. And I realized that the ones that had been taking me by the hand through the world were really just stumbling in the dark. I couldn’t follow them anymore. I needed to find my own way out. And only then could I come back, and take them there with me.

I finally reach the street I once lived on. Years ago, I’d left to come back. But did I come back too soon? I still feel like the teenager who ran away. Really, I’d regressed with Samia. She coddled me, I welcomed it, I lost myself in her arms. I realized this too late, before graduation, when I met her father and tried to act like the man I wasn’t yet. There were miles between who I wanted to be in college and who I had become. I was twenty-two, I still could not cook or pay my bills, and I was graduating without a job. I found, through his eyes, that I’ve only been a child. That all I’ve done as my parents’ son is take from them all the love they could spare, then leave. I did the same to Samia. Only now have I returned. Too soon to be a man for them, too late to be absolved. The old apartment building looms over the houses in the street. Everything is dark or dim in the rain; even the street lights are off tonight. I enter the front door, a bright light confronts me, and everything is exposed. My clothes release the water they absorbed the last thirty minutes, irrigating onto the mat. I rest my bags against the wall. I buzz 3A and wait. I think of my father, what he would do in my situation, arriving home with nothing to show. I remember the first time he drove me to a basketball game, and I was nervous like I am now, I couldn’t speak. And though he hated me spending my evenings at practice, when he saw me biting my nails, he took my hand and said: Inzi, a man is not prepared, but improvised. Improvise yourself.

I buzz again, there’s still no response. This time, I lay my suitcase on the floor and zip it open. I take the keys from the laced pocket underneath, I pray they still work. They do.

The lies I’ve told them and myself trickle away with the water on the floor. All that’s left is myself, and I renew in the wake of the new white light overhead. Boxes to my left are stacked like stairs, and the new couch on the other side has a rip right in the gut. It’s a nice leather couch, albeit inconveniently placed right before the mailboxes, more an obstacle than furniture. Otherwise, the building hasn’t changed. I walk up the stairs with my three bags, dripping everywhere, stopping and panting every few steps, but determined to meet my family, to mend the last few years over. To be the eldest son that my parents thought they had raised. I’ll improvise.

I arrive on my floor. The rich cherry wood of our front door reflects the hallway light, giving it the illusion of being polished, though it probably hasn’t been cleaned in years. I knock, leaning against it, huffing lightly from the workout the last hour has been. Of course there’s no response. But when I key into the apartment, all the lights are still on. No one’s in the living room. I check the kitchen, bathroom, Laila’s bedroom, my parents’, they're all empty. I even open the sliding closet, but all I find are the two boxes they keep documents in. I check the time, it’s halfway to eleven. If they’re at Tarawih, they’ll be coming home soon. I go back to the bathroom and dry myself with what's probably Laila’s towel, then settle in my bedroom—but something’s off. It could be the color of the walls, a blueish green instead of greenish blue. Or the prayer mat left open on the far end of the room. No. It’s the bedside table. Someone moved it to the opposite side of the bed, closer to the door. A crazy thing to do. It was so much better next to the window, it fit perfectly, and there was an outlet there as well. Now that outlet is covered by the bed frame and the only other one is all the way at the desk. I plug in my phone charger to the desk outlet and text my mother I’ve arrived so they’re not jumpscared when they come home. I add that I noticed the bedside table has moved, and who decided to change it? Was it Abu? Does he know the bedside table is better on the other side, because of the outlets and the window and the space between the bed and whatnot? I feel weak. I lie down. The bed swallows me whole. It still has my imprint, even after all this time, after its flings with other sleepers; it missed me. My bed, the Q70-SBS, they’ll never forget me, I know. In my half-awakeness, I theorize what a love child between a bus and bed would be. I’m drifting away. Maybe an RV? Laila would know. I see shapes of dark blue. I’ll ask her in the morning.

<br>
I dream of stifled sunlight and cool, running water flooding in from under my door. The prayer mat floats up to my bed, soaked through like thin paper. I get up. I place my feet on the floor. I wade through freezing water, until the blinds start to glow. I look down. I can’t see my body. The janamaz dissolves. The blinds unveil a sun that’s burning bright red, skies bleeding in its rays—sharp clouds doused in red sunlight: like flames, like fire.

### 2
Zahra feels Haram for staring at Zain like this. If anyone’s noticed, they might think she’s in love with him. She’s not, but she still refuses to look away—the Imam is reciting the Nikah Dua, and she must extract as much of him as possible before the contract is signed. So far, all she’s learned is that he has eye freckles (which must be some mutation), that his eyelashes are longer than hers (he probably doesn’t even groom them), and that he prefers to sit squatting, at least until his father told him to sit properly. Nothing of use. She still barely knows who he is. Zahra glances at her mother, sitting eagerly next to the Imam, looking like a dog who heard her owner park the car in the driveway and is now waiting for a knock at the door. This is the happiest she’s looked in years. Zahra knows escaping isn’t an option, not with her mother here. Her lungs loosen, she pulls a hair from the back of her hand. She can’t take this from her.

The Imam stutters. Zain, he says, is joining in matrimony with Aisha—Zahra’s mother’s name, not hers. No one reacts to this mistake, except Zain, who’s holding in his smile, his eyes and nose under hydraulic pressure—two short seconds pass before the laugh rips from the base of his sinuses, with a snort, then he gives up and lets his whole chest join in. Zahra squeezes her shalwar. It must be a sin to laugh in this sacred ceremony. But one by one, the relatives around them begin to smile, some giggling—the Imam stops talking. Everyone falls quiet again. He chuckles softly. Astaghfurullah, he says. They relax. Some words are passed in the crowd. Zain pats the Imam’s shoulder and apologizes. It is no problem, the Imam says. We will start over anyway.

The ice is broken and the families behind Zahra and Zain close in. This would comfort Zahra if the people on her side were actually her family, but so few of her relatives came that Zain’s side had to donate ten or twenty people to hers. It’s not her fault; her mother’s family is small, she has no siblings, and her elder relatives are either too weak, too poor, or too dead to come to Lahore. Even Zahra’s best friend Syma had to take care of her dada back in Karachi. (He’s really taking his time to die.) Zahra doesn’t have a father’s side either. Or a father at all. Her mother never told her where he went, or if he was even alive, although Zahra never minded that much. She saw no reason to ask. She liked growing up alone with her mother. They would eat together every night after cooking for and cleaning after Uncle Ravi. Sometimes they’d get the T.V. if he retired early, or they’d go on the roof if it wasn’t too hot. It was like they were best friends. And Aisha spoiled Zahra. She cleaned the dishes after them two, gave her the better bed in the ex-storage room. She took no pay from Uncle Ravi, just a deal that he’d house them, pay for groceries, and send Zahra to a good school. The only thing Aisha wanted from Zahra was for her to get married and give her grandchildren. Though Zahra would have done anything else. The first time she met Zain she hated him. Five years ago, on a Friday, the last time she had talked to him, really talked to him, with no one else around. What her mother doesn’t know.

<br>
Zahra knew Zain’s father, Uthman, before she knew Zain himself. And she knew him not as Zain’s father, but as just another uncle. Except this uncle was in her house, every Friday after school, having chai with her mother, like they were best friends. The two had gone to college together, that was all Zahra knew. Though she also knew that he was Uncle Ravi’s younger cousin, and that he had found Aisha this job, saving them both. Zahra also knew that when her mother was with Uthman, she giggled constantly—when most of the time, she never even smiled—and rubbed her thigh like it was a cat, or an infant falling asleep, even as they sat miles apart.

But she hated people like Uthman. All the time, she spoke with disgust of these burger families, burger boys, educated at a British seminary, studying English, the ugliest language in the world—and how they had turned their back on their nation for greed, for security. These Western educated men, pick-me cucks of the late British empire, they’d never realize the gora hates them, their bastardized British accents, and their skin color too. Give them a few generations, Aisha would say, and they’d be lost, bodies without a soul, wandering between an ex-colonizer who hated them and a country they turned their back on.

Yet when she was with Uthman, she forgot. She forgot that he was a rich boy from a rich family picked by the colonial government. She forgot that her laugh was considered ugly—it was a chortle, loud and genuine, easily infectious if she was not chastised each time she took up space. She forgot that she hated Lahoris, light-skinned snobs of culture and beauty, and that she had wished to return to Kashmir after she’d left for university. When the war was over, she had said, but the war was never really over, and then her parents died suddenly, leaving her with the embers of a dream: regret. Every Thursday, Aisha asked Zahra to clean her room for Uthman’s visit, even though he never left the living room, and every Friday, Zahra came home from school to see an extra car parked in the driveway, the driver waiting under the shade. She said salaam to Uncle Uthman, then walked to her room, opened and closed the door, and tiptoed back to the end of the hallway to watch her mother evolve completely into someone else.

This time, there was someone else in the room. It was a boy Zahra’s age, sitting idly with his father while Zahra’s mother sat on the chair she normally sat on that was abnormally far from the couch. Zahra could tell he was a youngest child immediately, or at least that he had older siblings, the way he looked so needy, unable to entertain himself, waiting for instruction from the adults. Immediately she was over him.

“Zahra jaan,” Aisha said, “This is Uthman’s son, Zain. Do you remember him?”

“No,” Zahra said, with speech as dry as the inside of her mouth. She just walked a kilometer home in Lahore heat and needed a cold glass of water, not formalities.

“You met him at the reception three years ago, Zahru. Remember? He is your age.”

“Born only six months apart. What a coincidence!” Uthman exclaimed.

“Ok.” Zahra walked past the couch towards the kitchen. Guess she can’t spy on her mother today.

“Sorry bhaiya,” Aisha said softly, then turned to Zahra, speaking an octave higher than she normally did. “Zahra? Come say salaam to Zain, please jaan.”

Zahra rotated. “Assalamualaikum, it’s nice to meet you Zain bhai. Assalamualaikum, Uthman Mammu.” She nodded her head slightly at the men.

“It’s nice to meet you, Zahra,” Zain said, projecting his voice like he was trained. What a robot, Zahra thought.

“How is your schooling, Zahra?” Uthman asked.

“It’s okay Alhamdolillah.”

Uthman nodded. Aisha nodded. Zahra nodded. Zain began to laugh.

“Beta, stop that.”

“Sorry!” Zain said. “I laugh in awkward situations. Sorry.”

“Okay Zahra,” Aisha said. “You can go back to your room then. But come back and talk to your friend Zain after you are ready okay?”

Zahra nodded again, but this time no one else was nodding. She walked through the kitchen and poured herself mineral water with mineral ice, then retreated back to her room and started unpacking her notes and supplies into the desk her mother stopped using years ago.

“Hey.”

Zahra jumped. Pencils and two erasers escaped from her case. She turned, ready to stab the person with the pen in her hand.

“Hi,” Zain said again.

“How did you? I did not even hear the door open. How?”

“Oh. It was just open I think, Zahra.”

Zahra scowled. He’s lying, she thought to herself. And already addressing her by her first name too. She made a mental note.

“Sorry to walk in like this.”

“We cannot be alone together,” Zahra said. “You must go back to the living room.”

“Oh, I’m going to leave now actually.”

Zahra raised an eyebrow. “Normally Uthman uncle stays until Asr time.”

“Oh. We are not actually leaving. I am just going out. I was going to ask if you want to come with me, but I see you are busy now. I will be back later.” Zain made a motion to leave.

“Wait,” Zahra said. “Go outside?”

Zain smiled. “Just for fun.”

Her mother never let her outside. All Zahra had were the walks she took to and from school every day, and those were strictly timed. Once, a block before she got home from school, Zahra realized she forgot to take her workbook from school and had to walk back again. She eventually came home to see the local policeman, Muhammad (apparently he was Uncle Ravi’s cousin, but everyone seemed to be Uncle Ravi’s cousin), talking to her mother outside, who was crying, then bawling after seeing Zahra. How embarrassing. But Zahra still cherished her walks, brief as they were—she was someone who loved places, not really people, not really things. She loved to sit in the space behind the dumpster at school where she could watch the cars go by, or the little crevice in the pantry next to the window with the ladder that led to the roof where she read. She loved to be under the sky. Its vastness felt both distant and intimate, smothering, but freeing her, like a warm early monsoon wind. Walking under it on her way home, Zahra would feel the presence of God—she did not know it, but she could not understand it, and so she named it as such. Then she came home, to her mother’s domain, but she still dreamt of the sky, the way all things—dust, the birds, herself—float towards it on quiet days with a patient breeze.

Zain and Zahra walked through the living room, acting as normal as they could.

“Where are you two going?” Aisha said, sounding satisfied.

“Zahra is just showing me something in the basement,” Zain said. He’s good at lying, Zahra thought. Another mental note.

“Oh, the old chess set?”

She mumbled and they left the room. They exited the house, Zahra smelt something airy, like the smell of eucalyptus, and she prepared to block out Zain for the duration of their walk to watch the sky. But then they got into a car, and when she looked up, she did not see the sky. She saw a piece of gum.

“What is happening?” Zahra said.

“I told you we’re going out.” Zain put his keys into the ignition.

“Wait.” She widened her eyes at Zain. “Wait. Why are you sitting in the driver seat?”

Zain grinned. “This is what the movies call a ‘joyride’.”

Zahra tried to escape, but Zain had already started reversing, and to make things worse, he turned on the radio to terrible American songs.

“Are you allowed to drive?!” she yelled. “You’re—we’re only sixteen!”

“My Abu taught me.”

“But allowed?! Don’t you have a driver?”

“He’s inside,” Zain said, almost hitting the gate. He turned the radio up the moment he got on the road. “We have a deal where he pretends not to see me take the keys.”

Zahra regretted everything at once. She screamed over the music for attention.

“Relax, Zahra. No one can hear you anyway. Our parents are probably laughing and whooping now.”

“They’re weird,” Zahra said blankly.

“Yeah.”

It was silent for a few seconds.

Zain drove to the intersection. Zahra felt completely lucid, looking around in each direction multiple times. It was like she had woken up from a happy dream and the room was cold, the sun crashing into her eyes.

“AHHHHHH!” Zahra yelled again.

“Zahra, please.”

“CAR ON THE LEFT!”

“I can see that, Zahra. Sit back. Put your seatbelt on.”

“I would put on three seatbelts if I could bhai.”

“Blast off!” Zain slammed the gas and Zahra became one with the carseat. She couldn’t speak.

Zain sped down the bumpy, unmaintained road, meandering around cars, sometimes driving in two lanes at once. Pieces of Zahra’s soul escaped from her body each time the gas was pressed, car honks were exchanged, or a motorcyclist yelled at them. (Zain yelled back of course.) Unable to move, or even complain over an endless series of guitar solos, Zahra began to watch everything they passed on the side. She noticed the finishes of new imported cars trying to outmaneuver Zain, the clothes and skin tones of lost tourists on the side of the road, then the shape of young, tall trees that guarded a park they passed by.

“Eucalyptus,” Zahra whispered.

“Hm?”

Zahra looked back at the black trunk and thin, tiny leaves. “Can you reverse?”

“No, Zahra,” Zain looked at her sardonically, “I can’t reverse.”

“I thought I saw a eucalyptus. I read about this but I have never seen them.” She stretched her neck and squinted but the trees were gone from sight. She sat forward. “They’re new to Pakistan. The Forest Institute made a big project a few years ago, in the eighties, to spread them here. Lahore was one of the first cities.”

Zain smiled at Zahra, clearly impressed. His feelings are always so obvious, Zahra thought. Except when he’s lying. “I didn’t know you knew so much of our history,” he said.

“It’s not a good thing,” Zahra continued. “The eucalyptus takes a lot of water. And Pakistan needs water. The tree is invasive, to be honest, but people think any tree is better than no tree.”

“I bet America was involved,” Zain said as a half-joke.

Zahra nodded. “Yes. They are funding the forest institute. They probably did this without knowing eucalyptus takes up a lot of water in arid climates, like Pakistan’s.” Ironic, she thought, that we are sitting here talking of America’s doings while listening to their rock songs.

The country was changing. Zahra could see it more with each street they passed. The motorcyclists were dressed in jeans, and Pizza Huts had appeared from nothing, sprouting from the ground like the invasive eucalyptus trees. Zahra saw on the news last week that McDonald’s was planning to open their first outlet in Lahore. She was sure her mother would be disgusted by this news, though the people on the T.V. looked ecstatic. The car reached a red light. A street vendor handed a schoolboy a kabob in a burger bun. Zahra didn’t know what rock song Zain was singing along to on the radio, but she knew it sounded like Shaytan.

“Look,” Zain said, pointing to Zahra’s side.

Four posh Lahori women were walking out of a salon, admiring each others’ hair.

Zain cracked up. “Look at their hair! They look like cartoons.”

“It’s Westernized haircut,” Zahra said. “Look at their skin too, so light.”

“Maybe they are Kashmiri.”

“I think they used skin lightening cream.”

“Everyone is using skin lightening cream, Zahra. Maybe you should too.”

Zahra glared at Zain. She never understood why she was so dark, despite the fact that her mother was from Kashmir. Again, she wondered who her father was, where he came from, what the color of his skin was. Then she evicted the thought.

“I don’t like that Pakistan is changing so much,” she said. “We are only being colonized again, letting them control our culture and economy like this.” Zahra was parroting her mother, but she still believed every word she said.

“I think it’s good, Zahra. The country is still very new. It has been changing every year. We may as well see what the world has to offer. And look at the movies and the music we have made in the last ten years!” He grinned at Zahra, not a thought behind his eyes. “Enough of talking of ideas. Now it’s time to live!”

Zain turned the radio up, again, and Zahra plugged her ears, scoffing at Zain’s naivety. It’s easy to be optimistic when you are given everything you want in life. Yet she knew, in this car ride, she had seen more of Lahore than she had in her life so far. It had been years since she’d wandered outside of her safe, protected life with her overbearing mother in Defence. Zain, the rich and spoiled boy, had likely been out more than her. And though her ears hurt from his rock song singing, and her hand clutched the chair as he sped, her world was slowly opening up, and Zain, slowly, was becoming a part of it.

“Bhai!” Zain shouted. “Bhai, hey, come on bro, get off!”

It took Zahra a few seconds to piece together what was going on. They were waiting at an intersection, and there was a man at the hood of their car. He seemed to be wiping their windshield with a black squeegee.

“Hey!” Zain reached outside his window, trying to grab his shirt, but he evaded. The man then threw water onto the windshield from a bucket that materialized out of thin air.

“Ay, bhai, enough!” Zain grabbed a stick from the backseat. Zahra didn’t know why he had a stick in the backseat. Zain held it out the window and started hitting the man with the stick from the backseat.

“Zain!” Zahra shouted, holding him back, “Zain, what are you doing?”

The man ran away, cursing back at Zain. The cars in front were moving again.

“Damn beggars always want your money.”

“That was very mean. He was just trying to help.”

“No, he was trying to get my money. He wouldn’t have let me leave if I didn’t pay him.”

“Still, you can give—”

Zain accelerated into an opening in the other lane, receiving two short honks as he passed by. Squeezing between a truck and a car, he reached the roundabout. He swerved in front of two cars—another four honks, Zahra counted—then snaked between tens of cars facing all sorts of directions at once. Zahra clutched her chair even harder, and looked straight ahead. The honking was constant, neverending. She was terrified again.

“I know how you feel,” Zain said to Zahra, glancing towards her, slowing down in empathy.

Zahra shot him a look of dismay. She felt she was being played with.

“I am not trying to make you feel you will die. Trust me, I have done this many times before.”

“With different women in the front seat?” Zahra accused.

“No,” he chuckled. “No, no, not like this, normally it is by myself. But I felt this way, too, when I left Defence for the first time. It is scary, I know. But there is so much value in exploring the world, opening yourself to it. You learn about yourself, and what makes you in common with everyone else.” He turned into a neighborhood street, and it was quiet again. “Here at home, our parents treat us like love is protection. They love us by sheltering us from the world. But you know, I remember, when I started secretly driving outside Defence, that was the first time I wanted to come home. And I was happy to come home. I think love should always feel different. I think it should make you grow. Not always keep you the same.”

Zahra would have never guessed Zain would have thought seriously about anything, let alone himself. She struggled to place this feeling alongside the others she held, about him, her world, Pakistan, her family. None of it made sense. They turned onto the street she lived on. Zain backed up the car into the gate, resting his arm on the back of her seat. Her stomach was turning. Everything inside her was moving. She had many feelings she couldn’t organize, and this arm behind her only made them more jumbled, more intense. More than anything, Zahra felt confused. Confused, stressed, a little curious. And yet, through it all, or from it all, she felt alive.

<br>
Once Zahra entered the house, all illusions were broken. She spotted herself in a mirror in the foyer, frazzled and weak, rogue hairs sticking out of her hijab. She walked up the stairs with Zain close behind, still breathless, unable to think, let alone speak. They reached the living room. Zahra’s mother and uncle Uthman were standing next to the display cabinet, examining Uncle Ravi’s figurines.

Aisha turned around. “Oh, just in time,” she said, “We were just getting ready to leave.” But Zahra knew they had probably been ‘getting ready to leave’ for at least thirty minutes now. “How was the chess?”

“Good,” Zahra said, her breath a little short.

“You look ten years older,” Zain said, coming up from behind. Zahra glared at him.

“Intense game of chess, I see. Who won, Zahru?” Aisha asked.

Zahra couldn’t process anything. She stood there like a deer in the headlights and let the lie dissolve from her shoulders and fall slowly onto the ground.

“She did,” Zain cut in. He walked in front awkwardly. “Your daughter is very good at chess, I didn’t know.”

“Oh? I did not even know you knew chess, Zahra jaan. Where did you learn?”

“I taught her. Just now.”

Zain was lying for her, Zahra thought, and lies are disgusting and Haram. But this lie felt different. It felt like compassion, like he cared for her somehow.

“Zahra beat you?!” Aisha was shocked.

“Yes,” Zain said. His body relaxed, he spoke smoothly. “She is a natural, Mashallah.”

“Mashallah,” Aisha said. “Your Uthman uncle and I used to play chess in university, at a table in the library.” She smirked and glanced at Uthman. “Remember that?”

Uthman put his hand in a fist and punched her on the shoulder gently. “I hate chess,” he said.

“Me too,” Zahra said, and she tucked a strand of hair behind her hijab.

<br>
The best friends began talking again, so Zahra said her salaams and retreated to her room, or rather the hallway before the living room. As Zahra had predicted, Aisha and Uthman stayed in the living room for another hour, sitting far apart as usual but speaking as if they were in each other’s arms. While they talked of adult things like politics and history, Zain sat patiently on the chair. Normally when Zahra eavesdropped, she was listening for her mother, picking up on the mannerisms and words she never used with her. It was a way of knowing her mother, the mother she was not shown. But this time, it was Zain she listened for, and for the first time, she considered reentering the living room. She wanted to ask Zain what he thought of politics and history, to pick his brain on Pakistan, on America. Maybe she’d ask him what it’s like to have two older sisters, or why his pants are too tight. Her intrigue drew her, but her fear kept her, fear not just of Zain, but how she felt about him. So she remained there, cross-legged on the floor, and brought namkeen mix and milk to eavesdrop with her. Nothing interesting happened. She almost fell asleep. Eventually Uthman uncle checked the time, panicked, and rushed out with Zain. Aisha had called Zahra’s name to say salaam, but she didn’t respond, so the two of them left without saying goodbye. Now Aisha was alone on the couch, staring at the wall. Once Zahra heard the car engine outside, she took her things and began to walk back to her room.

“Zahra?” Aisha said. Zahra froze. “Zahra jaan, come here.”

Did she know Zahra was there? Zahra tiptoed back to her room, threw the namkeen bag on the floor, opened and closed the door, and then finally entered the living room. “Yes Ammi?”

Aisha smiled at her. “Come sit down meri jaan.” She tapped the cushion next to her on the couch.

Zahra sat down.

Aisha got up. “Do you want some melon? I cut some for Uthman Ammu but I forgot to serve it to him.”

“No Ammi I’m not hungry.” Zahra got up to stop her. “Ammi, I’m fine, please.”

“Sit down, Zahra, I’ll get it for you.”

“Ammi, please, I don’t want to eat.”

“Hm,” Aisha said. She walked back to the couch and sat down. Zahra sat down too. Her mother looked tired, or aged. Zahra stared at the fabric of her shalwar. She followed the golden outline on her dupatta, leading over her chest, around her arm, to the back of her head, where gray hairs spread like locusts on once lush greenery, now bare.

“Do you know who your Uncle Uthman is?” Aisha asked. It was a forced question, in the tone parents use when they’ve been preparing a discussion for hours, waiting for the right time to ask. Zahra clenched up.

“He’s over every week, Amma. He’s your friend from college.”

“Uthman’s father was a high ranking official in the British colonial government, before the partition. Their family is very well educated. You know, he is the one who convinced Uncle Ravi to give us this position. He saved us from our situation.”

‘Our situation’, to her mother, referred to almost becoming homeless when Zahra was four. Despite that ‘situation’, Zahra had always found it unsettling how grateful Aisha was to Uthman, especially considering his wealth, and his family’s relationship to the colonialists.

“And how did you like Zain?” Aisha continued.

“He’s okay, Amma,” Zahra said, though something flared in her neck, her chest floating above her head.

“You managed to talk to him?”

Zahra glanced at her mother’s face, and pursed her lips. She tried to collect herself. She hated being watched, she hated when her feelings escaped her grasp. She rubbed her thumb against her palm. Black eraser shavings appeared from nothing. She wiped them off.

“They’re a very good family.”

“I don’t want to get married to him,” Zahra said—everything crashed down.

“Give him a chance, beta.”

“I don’t want to get married.” Her chest was in her stomach now. The feelings were gone, replaced by shame, flashing images of housework, domestic arguments, logistics. Everything was tight.

Aisha got up and walked to the kitchen. Zahra stared at the figurines in the cabinet. The thoughts of Zain she had entertained felt far from her now. The cabinet was open; it was supposed to be closed. A cute woven camel figurine looked at her, Zahra considered taking it for herself. Uncle Ravi wouldn’t notice, she thought, if I only took one. But then Aisha came back with the plate of melons, and Zahra put her hands back in her lap.

“I don’t want to get married, Ammi,” Zahra repeated.

“Here, have one.”

Zahra took a melon from the plate out of obligation. She bit into it, it was crunchy and hard to chew. The sourness made her saliva glands shrink.

“Here, have one more.”

“I’m not hungry Amma.”

Aisha stared, so Zahra took another. This one was flavorless, and so soft that it fell apart in her hands when she bit it; she had to catch it with her other hand. Now both of her hands were sticky. She resisted the urge to rub them on the couch.

“You don’t know what it was like,” Aisha said. “Before we came to this house.”

Oh God, Zahra thought, this again. “I do remember, Amma.”

“You don’t know what it’s like.”

“Ammi, I—”

“Working for this man. Living in fear every day, that if something goes wrong and Ravi kicks us out, we have nothing. No home. No school.”

Zahra knew she would lose if her mother went on like this. So she gathered herself and pushed back. “I’m going to go to college for us, Mama,” she said, confidently. “I will graduate and find a job. Then we will find our own apartment. Maybe it is not too big. But then you will not have to work for Uncle Ravi with me. You can relax. We will put furniture on the roof, a chair and table next to the thing we put our clothes on. Maybe we can get a couch! Then we can eat and look at the sunset. After, the stars. We can do anything, because I will be working, making money just for us. Not staying at home, being just a wife.” Zahra looked up at her mother in anticipation. “I don’t want to get married,” she said again.

Aisha sighed, and Zahra felt a sinking feeling. Her mother hadn’t listened, she could tell. “The West has corrupted you. So you will do all of that with what money?” she said. “There is no way Uncle Ravi will pay for your college unless you are engaged to Zain.”

“I-I can get a scholarship like you—”

“Do you want some chai?” Aisha got up again and went to the dining table. “We still have some left over.” She took a cup and started pouring.

Zahra watched her mother pour the chai carefully. Her arms looked frail. Zahra noticed wrinkles on her hands, and when she turned around, on her face too. Aisha handed the chai to Zahra and waited until she took a sip to sit. “It’s hot,” Zahra said.

“Still? That thermos is very good Mashallah.”

Zahra was sure you don’t use Mashallah for objects like that but she didn't say anything. She also hated over-sweetened chai, it tasted like candy, but for adults. At least the condensation on the mug made her hands less sticky. She rubbed it around.

Aisha patted her hand on her thigh and sat carefully on the couch. “Zahra,” she said with finality, “I know you can provide for yourself. Maybe you can provide for me too.” She touched Zahra’s shoulder. “But what about your children? Do you think you will not have children? That you can stay like this the rest of your life?”

Zahra bit her tongue lightly. Aisha held Zahra’s hand. “Jaan, I went to college too,” she said. “I was like you. Uthman, he wanted to marry me, when I met him in uni. But I was scared, I wanted to do it on my own. Then, when I graduated, I could barely provide for myself. No one wanted to give me a job. And I could not go back home. I had you. My mother and father died. And I was still afraid. Everything had changed anyway. I learned I would always feel fear inside me, but better it’s a fear that I choose. I wish that I knew that then.

“I thought I could have you on my own, jaanu. Now I am living in a room I do not own. I cook food for someone else’s children before I cook for my own. And I am lucky to have that, even, now. I am lucky to still have you.”

Zahra realized this match was not about her or even Zain, but what her mother didn’t or couldn’t do. She started to say something, but Aisha got up, indicating their talk was coming to an end.

“Your Uncle Uthman and I have a special connection,” she said. She stood above Zahra, Zahra’s chin angled upwards like a table corner guard. “Most people of that status would not dream of marrying our family into theirs.” She breathed in deeply. Zahra watched her walk towards the kitchen and look back. It became clear to Zahra, in that moment, that there were things her mother knew and saw that she would never behold in her life.

“This is our only way out, meri jaan,” Aisha said. She looked past Zahra towards the glowing window. “This is your only way out.”

Aisha disappeared into the kitchen. Zahra would soon meet her there to cook dinner for Uncle Ravi and his family. Zahra would make the roti and set the table. After, they’d eat together, and clean. Then Zahra would get ready, and her mother would tuck her in with a kiss. Zahra would watch the moon from her bed. And every week, or every month, Aisha would bring up Zain, and ask Zahra to meet with him, and though she’d shake her head strongly and refuse, she would think of him, and what her mother said. Zain would become an idea to her, a stage of life, images and responsibilities crowding what was once just a funny boy she drove in a car with in Lahore.

So on the slow days, the cloudy, quiet days, Zahra would imagine him again, and remember their joyride. She would wonder what it would be like to pack the world she knew into her hand and build another with a new friend. Leaving was never an option for Zahra, yet Zain, even just for a moment, had opened a door, and beckoned her outside. It was bright there. The sun was intense, the people unrelenting, cars, planes, and all things industrial fighting for space, money, and time. It was no fantasy. Zahra was not one to escape. Instead, it felt a form of return, like going back to school after summer vacation, fasting again in Ramadan. Coming to Zain, falling into him, putting her life into his arms.

Zahra told herself she would only answer once she worked her feelings out, but she never did. She said yes not knowing any more than when she was with him that day, with his hand on her seat in his car.

<br>
Zahra is watching her mother at the walima. It is the only thing keeping her sane, as she sits on this stage, like she’s on display. This whole wedding week, she has been stuck. Always, there’s something she must do. Someone to smile at, or take pictures with. A chair to sit on, a distant family member to receive, a tradition to perform. The worst is that she has to look nice while doing it. Her cheeks hurt. She misses being outside. She misses the sky, her evenings, her walks—stuck, she watches her mother, as she scurries around the room, greeting people, ordering the workers around, pointing at different things. Now she is at the tables on the side. She nods at someone and the appetizers are unveiled. She steals a samosa and eats it like an apple as she walks to the front. She talks to the emcee—one of Zain’s friends—probably telling him to announce the food. He says something to her that makes her laugh. Zahra realizes she’s rarely seen her mother show her teeth while laughing, except from that awkward angle in the hallway near the kitchen when Uncle Uthman was over. She leans forward to get a closer look.

“Zahra?” says the one at her side.

Zahra leans back and looks at the voice. It almost startles her, being reminded that this is the man she’s marrying.

“What are you looking at?” he says, in a harmless tone. He smiles at her, his eyes dart, and Zahra realizes he’s nervous too—despite his cackling this week, his gelled hair, and his fancy white kurta. “Just wondering,” he mumbles. “You were smiling.”

“Just my Ammi.”

“Why?”

“Do I need a reason to watch my mother?” she snaps.

“S-sor—”

“Just kidding, Zain.” She smiles, Zain relaxes. “I just have never seen her smile this much. Or eat this many samosas.”

“How many?”

“Three, I think, so far.”

“Is she hungry?”

Zahra sighs. “I am happy for her. She is the one who is always stuck, working, worrying, and I am the one eating and having fun. Now she can do that. And I am the one stuck.”

“Stuck? Why stuck, Zahra? You are not stuck.”

Of course he’d think that, Zahra thinks, unruly man. “I am not allowed to leave, or even get off this stage,” she says slowly. “So I watch her instead.”

“You can get up if you want to.”

“No I can’t.” Zahra wonders if she was right in marrying this man. Not that she had her pick of men. But not that she would marry anyone in the first place, if not for her mother.

“This is your wedding. You can do what you want.”

“No,” Zahra says. “Really, it is her wedding. It’s for her, not me.”

“What about me?”

Zahra purses her lips. “You get half of the wedding.”

“Ok. I dedicate my half to you.”

Zahra blushes. She feels hot in her wedding dress. She smooths out a wrinkle on the cloth. “You can’t do that,” she says softly.

“Why not?” he asks, grinning.

“It’s not allowed.”

“It’s my half. I can do what I want with it.” Zain shuffles in his seat and touches Zahra’s hand with his. “I wish I can hold you.” He puts his hand back in his lap.

“We cannot yet.” Zahra shudders at the thought of touching him. It took years to fathom marriage just as an idea. She had not even considered having a head on her shoulder, a hand on her waist, as consequences.

“We signed the Nikah,” Zain says. We can.”

“Be patient.” Zahra watches a baby trying to eat a samosa. Half of the filling is falling onto his father’s lap. “But I am bored too.”

“Once the food comes out you won’t be bored.”

Zahra raises her eyebrow at him. “Why?”

“Just wait. Maybe we can watch your mother while it happens too.” He’s holding back another grin.

“What did you do?” Zahra asks. She notices Zain’s left eyebrow is longer than his right.

“Just trust me. It will be fun.”

Zain looks back at the crowd, and Zahra does too. She scans for her mother, but she’s gone, maybe sitting behind a pillar or receiving a guest at the front. Zahra sits back in her seat. This man is nothing but surprises and heart attacks.

<br>
After another hour of warm reunions pass, the silver serving platters are carried out. The constant talking wanes, finally—it reduces to murmurs and the occasional sound of utensils hitting plates. The catering people place the platters on the two long tables at the ends of the rooms, and Zahra watches Aisha scurry over to the emcee for the announcement.

“What is the surprise?” Zahra says to her husband.

“Just wait,” he says. “Wait and watch the people.”

Zahra scans the room, trying to count the number of guests present. One, two hundred—no—it must be three, or four.

“Look at their faces. You know they want chicken tikka masala. Jalfrezi. They probably expect nihari, entitled uncles and aunties they are.”

Zain’s tone of voice worries Zahra. She’s never heard the golden boy talk with such disgust. “Assalamualaikum everyone,” the emcee says. “Dinner is ready now, Alhamdolillah. After everything is uncovered, please proceed based from your table number, Inshallah, starting with tables one to ten.”

The emcee nods and the food is uncovered. Each half of the crowd leans to their end to see what is served, split like the red sea. A young child falls over their chair trying to get an angle. Then someone gasps, followed by another—a wave of whispers runs through the ends to the center. Zahra leans, trying to make out the food. It isn’t curry on the platters. No nihari, biryani, kofta. “Is that pizza?!” Zahra squeals to her husband.

“Not just pizza,” he says. “It’s Pizza Hut.”

“A—plozalahumat??”

The whispers have turned to murmurs now.

“You are familiar with Pizza Hut?” Zain says, looking at Zahra. “I am impressed. Maybe we are a good match after all.”

“Not even tandoori chicken? Naan?”

“Oh, there is tandoori chicken. There’s tandoori chicken on the Pizza Hut.”

Then the image seizes Zahra’s eyes. Otherwise normal cheese pizzas infested with tandoori chicken pieces on every slice. Masala sauce lining the crust of veggie pizzas like barbeque sauce. Others are ravaged with beef kabob, Afghani tikka, Bihari chicken—then Zahra sees it. Two tandoori chicken pizzas at the end, but stuffed into their crusts—beef seekh kabobs?! This is an abomination. It must be Haram. The crowd groans, the murmurs become shouting; a group of four uncles walk out in protest. Zahra turns slowly towards her husband, shaking now.

“I-is that—”

“Yes,” Zain says, smiling cheek to cheek, an evil man. “Yes, tandoori chicken pizza with seekh kabob stuffed crust. A marvelous creation.”

“La hawla wa la quwwata illa billah.” Someone drops a glass on the floor and it shatters.

“Subhanallah,” he says.

“I—I think I’m going to faint.”

“Worry not, jaan. This is the best food in Pakistan.”

“Zain, please.” Zahra takes his hand. “Zain, you can’t do this. Please tell me you have Pakistani food coming.”

“This is Pakistani food,” Zain says, mildly annoyed. He pulls his hand away and breathes in. “This whole week, we have had jalfrezi, masala, chicken tandoor. Always, every day, the same food, the same spices. And not just us. It’s every shaadi in Pakistan, stuck in this cycle. No longer.” Zain puts his arm around Zahra and pulls her to him. He motions with his arm as if his words will appear in the sky. “Remember this day, Zahra jaan, when the Shaadi was changed forever. From this day on, Pakistani people will be liberated from serving orthodox Pakistani food at their wedding.” He motions to the pizza, then addresses the crowd, none of whom are listening. “The day Zain dared to serve pizza at his Walima.”

Zahra has never felt this feeling before. Something fragile in her stomach bursts open, then runs through her blood. She looks up at her husband from within his arms. In his eyes, she sees fire, in his hair, dandruff. He squeezes her shoulder, and in his smile, Zahra sees him as a child, as a father, as an elder all at once. She wonders if this is what they call love.

<br>
Zahra has Inzamam a year later. She holds him tight inside her arms. His thick hair stands straight up no matter how many times she combs it down; his hands grasp her fingers with certainty, or trust. The lucidity returns, from the car, from the wedding, but stronger, a hundred times. The life behind her feels unreal. The life before her feels opaque. And in her arms is a living being, one she must guide through a world she barely understands. But in her heart is something new—something writhing, something raw. She does not know what it is, only that it must be felt. Only that it must be let out.

### 3
I wake up and immediately something’s wrong. The sun is out and there’s no water boiling in the kitchen. The T.V. isn’t turned to max volume. My dad isn’t at the door telling me to wake up for no reason at all. One night in my bed and my body’s adjusted to home; seven years of loud mornings must have etched themselves into me. At least, my mother would have woken me up for Fajr. I jump out of bed. I walk around the apartment. No one is here still. I’m alone.

Immediately I begin a text blast. I go over, in my head, my friends from Jackson Heights. Sharjeel, my first friend from high school—we became friends from seeing each other in the bathroom three days in a row—he went to college here. Albert, from tennis, he lives in Elmhurst but might have heard something. Then there’s Ahmed, my ex-neighbor—he could still live in this building with his parents. He went to NYU. Is it odd to knock on his door? I shouldn’t. They’ve probably moved, anyway. I text all three of them. *hey Sharjeel* | *hey Albert* | *hey Ahmed*.  *long time no talk. look, i just got home and my family’s gone. and the deli nearby closes at ten. i feel like something’s wrong, do you know anything that’s happened?*

While I wait, I tally my other options. Ammi and Abu are still M.I.A., and the only other family we have in America is Bari-mamu, who I haven’t spoken to in a decade and wouldn’t know how to if I tried. It becomes clear to me that gone with my parents are tens or hundreds of connections to family and my lineage, something I’ve assumed access only because I’ve assumed access to my parents, never doubting that when I come back, they’d be waiting for me.

I consider calling the cops briefly, but when it comes to the cops in Queens, if they aren’t doing nothing, they’re making it worse. My friend told me he called the cops on a burglar once and the police arrived an hour late and then almost shot his dad. But I don’t exactly have options. I pace. I walk to the living room. Outside the window, the empty park playground hides under a thick cluster of trees. A kid is vomiting under one of them. I decide I’ll call the cops tonight as a last resort. I’ll even kneel before the police commissioner and beg. Still, I feel like I’m forgetting something. I spot the T.V. remote, I grab it, turn it on. The volume startles me, and probably the neighbors as well. I sit on the couch and switch to the news. I start to scroll on my phone too.

Now every kidnapping, murder, disappearance is my family. *Father and daughter from Corona, Queens disappear after late-night prayer at local mosque*. *Man and woman receive minor injuries when black bear released at Forest Park*. *Teenage girl from East Elmhurst disappears during cheerleading trip to New Jersey*. I click on the last one because it’s the closest to Jackson Heights, but it’s not Laila. She’s not the type of girl to do cheerleading anyway, not that I would know anymore.

After thirty minutes of paying more attention to the news than I ever have in my life, I collapse on the couch. My texts are still empty—and the WhatsApp chat I have with my mother still has just one checkmark. I message and call Ammi, Abu, and Laila too. No luck. An ache appears in my neck. I stretch my head out and it goes away, but when I stop moving, it hurts even more. So I sit up and sit there, rolling my head around my neck while the news plays on repeat in the background.

Then I remember Miguel, the man my mom mentioned was staying in my bedroom. I don’t know who he is, but he must be my best shot at finding what happened. I rush to my room where he allegedly stayed. First the closet, the desk drawers, then under the bed. Nothing. Then the bedside table, the garbage bin, the windowsill where the dead flies lay. Nothing again. My butt is pulled to the bed by a strong magnetic force. I take a deep breath. The prayer mat is still open, tucked in the corner of the room. My mother used to tell me to always fold up the janamaz or else Shaytan starts praying on it. I motion to get up, but I stop. Now since when does Satan pray? And if he is, why are we stopping him? If he’s praying there now, that is fabulous news. Just goes to show anyone’s capable of change.

<br>
I’m outside now, walking to the deli. I was going crazy, the last hour, sitting around waiting for a response, and I thought maybe Yaseen would know something. Also, I was hungry. I haven’t eaten in twelve hours. Which makes me feel guilty, that my family is M.I.A. and here I am trying to get Le Pastrami on Rye from Ye Olde Deli Shoppe. Guilt won’t stop me though. But I wallow in it while walking just to make myself feel better. Feeling guilt always lessens it, for me.

The deli’s open now, and they seem to have done well for themselves. They’ve repainted the walls a subtle light blue, and reoriented the shelves to be vertical, not horizontal, so all the aisles are visible. Add a pattern on the wall and you have Boss’s first interior design.

“Hey boss,” the man behind the counter says.

I nod to him, still looking around. It’s not Yaseen. I walk through the aisles, hoping he’s just in the bathroom and will appear in a bit. The laundry and toilet paper aisle looks the same, they’ve added Takis to the snack aisle and not much else. But the drinks aisle is stacked. They have maybe fifteen different types of Arizona iced tea, when last time, they had three. Still a buck. I pick one out of the fridge, iced tea and lemonade. It has some white dude on the front, which is odd that they can go from a pretty cherry blossom print for the green tea to George Bush’s balding cousin for this. Regardless, I keep it in my palm as I do my rounds.

“You want anything?” the deli guy asks when I get to the meat section. ‘Wawnt’ is how he says it. I stare at the Boar’s Head cold cuts displayed proudly under him. “You think that’s weird?” he says.

“What?” I say.

“All the meat out there, here. You think it’s weird huh? I see your face.”

“Oh, no. It's worse in Pakistan. They’ll have lamb carcasses just hanging and you choose it out.”

“Same in Yemen, brother. You from Pakistan?”

“Yeah, Lahore.” I spot some ham sitting there in the meats.

“Lahore ah? App kaisi hai?”

This guy’s accent is better than mine. “Alhamdolillah, bhai,” I say.

His eyes glow. “You Muslim?”

I nod and smile, clutching my chest. When coming out as Muslim, you have to look grateful, proud, and yet humble.

“Alhamdolillah! Assalamualaikum, brother. Everything is Halal here, not to worry. What’s your name?”

I glance at the ham, which is definitely not halal. “Indy. Inzamam.”

“I’m Abd-el-Kader.”

I look at him closely for the first time. His eyebrows are thick and almost horizontal. Compared to Yaseen, he’s short, and scrawnier, but his beard and mustache are also disconnected, and his hair is short and curly too.

“Is Yaseen here?”

He shakes his head. “Yaseen is gone,” he says wistfully; I want to ask what he means, but something tells me I shouldn’t pry. “So what you want?”

I order a pastrami with swiss and everything. He grabs a roll and starts to cut it. I notice a deep scar on the left side of his forehead, a deep mark that must have hurt a lot ten or twenty years ago. My throat is so dry that it sticks to itself when I swallow. I haven’t had water the whole morning. Abd-el-Kader starts humming something, probably in Arabic, based on the key. I look out the window and it’s become cloudy.

“First time I seen you,” Abd-el-Kader says as he stuffs the bread.

I want to say I live around here, but it’s no use lying, so I just nod and say nothing.  Leaves scatter past the deli door, all rushing towards the same place. I wonder where they could be going. I wonder if it will rain. I remember, suddenly, why I’m here.

“Hey, Abd-el—uh—”

“Kader. Toasted?”

“Huh?”

“Toasted? Kader.”

“What? Toasted? Yeah.”

He gives me a weird look. He puts the sandwich in the toaster.

“Listen, Abd-el-Kader, have you heard of anything going on in the neighborhood? Anything crazy? Like—”

“You thinking about the garbage, Inzamam. The people changed the day they take for garbage. Used to be three times a week. Now they don’t come on Mondays. But the people still put it out, Inzamam. They put the garbage out still. Garbage. All over. Everywhere, man.”

“Okay, good to know. But I’m talking about something on the order of people disappearing. Kidnapping, murder, police investigations, you know.”

He burrows his eyebrows. “Be careful, brother.” He takes the sandwich out of the toaster and starts to cut and wrap it up. “It’s crazy now. And be careful with the cops. Lots of them now, and they don’t like questions too. My brother, last week, he is pulled over, and they take him away, from no ID. And when I’m asking why, they told me they take me too. Crazy man. Getting crazy. So I don’t know what you mean. But be careful asking questions to the wrong people, you understand?”

I don’t follow this guy at all. I start to feel resigned. The leaves are still rushing, gathering. The wind rattles the door once or twice. I play my other card, I might as well. “Do you know anyone named Miguel in this area?”

Abd-el-Kader stops wrapping for a second and thinks. Then he looks at me. “Miguel? With a mustache?”

“Sure.”

“I know him, yes. Good man.”

My heart jumps. “Where is he?”

“All I know is he is working on 82nd. And 37th. You know? Colombian restaurant.”

“My favorite empanadas are on 80th.”

The guy smiles. “Miguel.”

“What about Zahra? Or Zain? Do you know them? Or if he knows them?”

He shakes his head.

“Thanks,” I say, regardless. This can’t just be a coincidence. “I gotta go.” He nods at me.

“Good luck with whatever you are doing, brother. I see you are on a journey.”

I pay and take the sandwich, I walk towards the door. The leaves are stampeding now. Tens, maybe hundreds at a time, and thousands since I entered. A leaf gets stuck in the crevice; I open the door, it flies away. Will the trees ever run out of leaves? Will the clouds run out of water? My throat stings when I swallow. I twist open my iced tea.

<br>
The brick buildings begin past 34th, on my way down 81st. Red brick or beige brick, shared gardens in the front; the Historic District hasn’t changed (probably because it’s historic). There’s a certain type of air among these apartments, what with their gardens out front, AC units popping out of the windows, and the occasional balcony. Slowly, I'm overcast by nostalgia; the air brushes my exposed arm. I used to walk around and sketch here. Sit on a stoop or bench. I was sixteen. I watched people spawn from their doors and disappear into them, until I forgot they were people at all. Only then could I know them. And only then could I draw them.

A hypothetical father is coming back from the grocery store to an apartment his father transferred to him years ago. He took on the mortgage, but got laid off last week and his spouse still doesn't know.

A hypothetical recent college grad got a good deal on her lease and moved in recently. She had fallen in love with the area and the finishes on her doors and fireplace, but she thought Jackson Heights was a lot closer to where her friends were living, and now she feels alone.

A hypothetical retired senior is taking a stroll bound for the park; it’s been six months since his estranged daughter had a kid. She texted him last night, and he’s been thinking of it all day: whether to uproot his quiet life and see his grandson, or keep his privacy and his pride.

I loved these people in Jackson Heights, the ones that didn't exist. They couldn't hurt me. No matter how callous, they were never manipulative. They wouldn't sneak crumpled paper sculptures of bombs into my bags, then say we were friends to my face. They wouldn't hide my computer without warning, tell me I didn’t know better, then complain I was getting distant. Real people were different from the ones made up, not in what they did, but how they did it, so arbitrarily. Consistency was all I asked from people, and I asked of them too much. So I relied on conception. I loved what they could be. Else I couldn’t love them at all.

Okay. That was a bit of an intrusive thought. My parents still love me, and just cause I'm salty over a few pulled ears and a WiFi curfew of ten P.M. doesn't mean I can’t love them for who they are. Allahu a’alam. We all need some fantasy to keep us alive, and in line. The stories we tell ourselves scaffold the life we experience. Which is a life we can’t control. Fantasy negotiates between will and observation, it gives us meaning in the absurd. So sue me if I lie. Sue me if I make life into sketches, then surround myself with them. We control nothing but narrative, in this world.

And they return, the sketches, I pass them. They stare, as if I’m the one not real. I feel responsible. It was I who left them, and came back like nothing’s changed. Everything has. I reach 39th; I swear a laundromat used to be right here. Now it’s an empty building for lease. I stop and examine the glass. There’s a faded sign on the far edge, where the glass meets the wall. I make out an L, and a faded black circle on its left, a growing mass. The circle will soon swallow the L, then the wall, then perhaps the building too.

I reach 39th and the sound of metal returns; I realize I’ve been walking in silence this entire time. A fruit vendor nods to me and I wonder if he recognizes me from somewhere. From my blind-spot, a middle-aged man appears. He starts speaking to the vendor in Spanish. There’s a cab stalling in the middle of the road, waiting for a young white lady to board. The door opens. Her slacks get caught in the step under the back door. The cars behind them honk incessantly. The woman is taking her time, unaffected by Jackson Heights’ urgency. The vendor and his friend don’t even look. Sometimes I wonder if the things I witness happen at all. Currently, I’m wondering how these two men can even hear each other with all the noise. They continue. Everyone else continues too. Her slacks are still stuck. The cars are still honking. I walk.

<br>
Turns out there’s more than one Colombian restaurant on 37th. Maybe even more than ten. The only data I have is Miguel, which is barely data at all. Six bytes of it, to be exact. I could fit a thousand Miguels into a floppy disk alone. A million into a flash drive.

The first one is a failure. I go in asserting the word “Miguel” and only get confused looks from the cashier and waitress. (They politely ask me to leave.) The second store is more of a cafe with wood furniture and an ugly orange accent. I ask if there’s a Miguel working there and they say no, then look past me at the next customer. I take the hint and move on.

The third store has a nice mural-esque design on the far wall. It has lots of pictures of people—portraits—spread among dark yellows, and greens. It must be trying to be a community space. This store ends up having a Miguel, they even bring him to me. I ask him, “Do you know an Abd-el-Kader?” and he burrows his eyebrows at me. “Conoces Abd-el-Kader?” I say, then louder, “Abd-el-Kader?!” and he, eyebrows still scrunched like dried string, shakes his head. I order a coffee and sit down. I’m making good time, at least. Maybe I’ll get through all the Colombian restaurants on 37th by next week.

My phone buzzes as I’m dissociating. It must have connected to the Link NYC Free Wifi. I check the notification. It’s Albert. I open it.

*hey inzamam. nice to hear from you. im sorry, but i have no idea what you’re talking about, i even asked my dad. let me know if i can help, or if you want to catch up while you’re here.*

I don’t respond. Instead, I open Sharjeel and Ahmed’s chat. Ahmed didn’t respond, Sharjeel’s message wasn’t even delivered. So I copy-paste my message to Sharjeel on Facebook too, just in case.

He responds immediately.

*Salaam Inzamam. Long time Subhanallah. I’m in Karachi now. I came here for medical school. I think I’ll stay Inshallah. How are you? Sorry to hear about your family. Zahra auntie was kind when I needed help in New York. I’m sure she’ll be back. -Sharjeel*

Since when do people sign their Facebook messages? Maybe he’s delirious, it’s probably midnight there. And do both of them think this is some catchup? I can't tell if it’s the coffee or the frustration that’s making me jittery. I get up before I disappear into the seat. I thank Other Miguel and leave the store.

The fourth restaurant is pretty and blue, and empty. Draped shades over long windows make the shadows loom from the tables to the counter. It would be scary if it wasn’t so Instagrammable, in a way.

“Hello,” the guy at the front says, smoothly. The espresso machines behind him are so shiny I wonder if they’re used at all. “What would you like?”

There are three things on the menu above him: Colombian coffee, orange juice, and empanadas.

“Do you have water?” I ask.

He shakes his head.

“Are you Miguel?” I whisper.

He only smiles. “What you are looking for is not here.” Then he points to his nametag: *Alejandro*. “Thank you for visiting.” He walks back to the machines. For some reason, I trust him.

The fifth restaurant is a bakery, and it’s bustling. It’s twice the size of the other places I’ve been to, and it’s full even during an off hour after lunch. I wait in line for the register.

The lady greets me.

“Hi.”

She starts throwing Spanish at me, and now I’m stressed out.

“Sorry. I don’t speak Spanish,” I say, embarrassed.

“Then what do you want?” she says, like it’s my fault I don't speak.

“Do you know if there’s a Miguel who works here?”

She thinks for a second, then lights up and nods. “You are lucky,” she says. “He is normally not here on Tuesdays.” She leaves. I wait at the counter.

It’s funny that people think I’m Latino, until it’s stressful, which is when they start speaking Spanish to me. I wish that I could share it with them, their dream, the brown solidarity. Instead I let them down. All because I took French in high school, possibly the most useless language to know. I never even visited France, because Abu said traveling internationally was risky. He still hasn’t given me my passport. It’s still probably in that box in the closet. Regardless, French has no right being the second most popular foreign language in the U.S. It’s not even a percent of the world’s population (I looked it up just now, while waiting). The Frenchies will say, well, population doesn’t determine influence. Whatever, colonizers. Next century, maybe keep to yourself.

Miguel appears. He smiles at me. He starts speaking Spanish too, and now I'm stressed out again.

“Sorry,” I say again. “No hablo español.”

Miguel sighs and gives me a face of pity. “What can I help you with?”

“Hi, thanks. Sorry. I’m looking for a Miguel that knows an Abd-el-Kader. Do you know him? I mean, know Abd-el-Kader.” I sigh. “Not Miguel.” I need to get out of here. “Sorry.”

“Yes, deli guy?”

My heart jumps, filled with hope. “Yes. Yeah!” He must know something. “Yeah, Abd-el-Kader. So listen, this is gonna sound weird, but did you ever stay with a Pakistani woman and man and their thirteen year old daughter?”

Miguel’s face twists. “Huh?”

“Okay, lemme try again. Do you know a Zahra? And Zain? And their daughter Laila?”

“Not really, sorry,” he says.

My heart sinks. My only lead is dissipating into coincidence.

“There is a Zahra I met at a community event. She is a good woman, helping out refugees.”

“Oh, that might be my mom.” I’m surprised she has such a reputation. “Do you know anything?”

“She is a good woman.”

“They disappeared sometime in the last week or two,” I continue. “I don’t know what happened to them. Her and my dad and sister too.”

His face gives me pity again, a more genuine pity, but still one I can't stand. Laila used to give me pity faces every time when I fought with Abu, even being just six years old. It only made me feel weaker, storming to my room with tears just to see her with a sad face in the hallway, eavesdropping.

I ask a few follow-up questions, but I know there’s no use; the futility of this lead is now clear. I am powerless, and clueless; I thank Miguel #2 and leave. On the way home, I stop at the park to eat my sandwich. And I realize I hate tomatoes. I’ve never liked them. I’ve been gaslighting myself into ordering them because someone told me they were one of a few sources of umami in Western cuisine. I always feel like I’m missing out. Like everyone is in on something I’m not, and they’re going to leave me eventually. Even something as stupid as tomatoes, like there’s an exclusive tomato club where they sit around and talk shit about tomato haters, or worse, the tomato hypocrites like me. Allah says in the Quran that when you see the hypocrites, ‘their appearance impresses you. And when they speak, you listen to their impressive speech. But in truth, they are like planks of wood leaning against a wall.’ And I'm a tomato hypocrite. I also feel like a piece of wood against a wall, in more ways than one. The sky is so dark it could be two in the afternoon or seven in the evening too. I wonder what the weather is like in Lahore. The clouds in Pakistan don’t play around like they do here. They will rain on you without warning. But then they’ll go away. There must be something American about the way clouds block the sun but don’t let loose any rain. America withholds. It takes things from you, but never tells you it does. Every day is the same, you never win, but never lose either. We suffocate ourselves with hope. Now the clouds are pulling away from each other, without revealing the sun. I realize I’ve forgotten what sunsets look like in New York. And I haven’t looked at the stars in months. Does the sky in Lahore breathe like it does here? I imagine a horizon surrounded by dust, a tint of burnt yellow. I wrap my sandwich up and wipe the sauce that’s on my hands. The clouds are splitting, or multiplying. I wonder if it will rain.

I get home defeated, ready to call the cops from the couch. I walk up the stairs, but when I get to the second floor, I stop. Across the hall is where the Qureshis live. Ahmed may be there right now, sitting with his parents and watching The Big Bang Theory. He would watch The Big Bang Theory. His parents would watch The Big Bang Theory too. I walk up to the door. I stare at the rust-colored doorknob, a rectangle with a long nose. First, I double text Ahmed: *Hey man, I’m literally in the same apartment building. Are you here? I’m gonna knock. It’s kinda an emergency.*

Immediately, he responds.

*hey Inzamam. Sorry, work has been crazy today. I’m not home, so don’t knock, please, I don’t know if my parents are there. Are you sure your fam didn’t just take a weekend trip? Maybe they’re doing Itikaaf.*

*hey*, I reply, a bit annoyed he only responded now. *they would have told me. Do your parents know anything? They’re in the same building. Are you sure I can’t just ask? I’m gonna call the cops soon. Maybe they’ll know something too.*

*okay. okay, listen, I’m coming to the masjid for iftar tonight. Why don’t you chill for now, hold off on calling the cops, and we can talk tonight. I’ll help you, if you’re pressed. Just chill for now, trust me it likely isn't that big a deal*

*fine*, I say, but as I walk back to my unit, I feel a bit of hope, again. I yawn. Maybe Ahmed’s advice was not misinformed. Maybe this is all a misunderstanding, and then an overreaction. I lie on the couch and let my eyes close naturally, feeling the sun’s heat massage my cheek.

<br>
Cars line the streets blocks away from the masjid, some double parked, others in front of a fire hydrant. The closer I get to the masjid, the more Desis I see appear on the streets, all walking in the same direction under the setting sun. Though I don’t look at them, and they don’t look at me, I feel something shared between us, like we're part of a pilgrimage, a journey, all orchestrated by one force.

A block away from the masjid, I start to be sandwiched by uncles, aunties, and kids. Cars are honking down the street. I get closer and see a truck squeezing slowly between two cars, one of which is triple parked. Muslims are crazy, man.

The masjid is still just a house, but it's expanded to the second floor and backyard. I walk to the gates, and all the groups once separate crash into each other in choruses of salaams, Ramadan Mubaraks, and Alhamdolillahs, asking how work is, when their son’s shaadi is going to be, if they heard that the local butcher closed down to nurse his sick father in Calcutta. I try to keep up with their conversations, but there’s too many to follow at once. It’s overwhelming.

I reach the gate that leads to the backyard and wait. Tens of people pass me to enter, none of whom I know, somehow. I feel foreign, a visitor, and it’s only been three years. Everyone here used to know me. The churn of time is unrelenting. I expected my return to be like slipping into old shoes, but instead I feel like a toe stranded outside a hole in its sock. Today, yesterday, New York has taught me: three years is a long time, what for how short it is.

I feel a hand on my shoulder. I turn around only to be smothered in a sweaty, smelly chest.

“Inzamam!” Ahmed says. “Dude, it’s great to see you.”

I gasp for air when he pulls me back out. “Wow,” I say, the first thing to come out of my mouth in hours. “You’re really tall.”

“It’s the shoes,” he says, pointing to his J’s. “I came straight from basketball. Though I did grow a few inches in college randomly.”

Ahmed was always taller than me, but not face-on-the-chest kind of tall.

“So? How’ve you been?” He pats my back.

I don’t know how to respond. “Well, you know my family’s gone.”

“Ah, come on man. I just saw them last week. I’m sure they’re fine.” He nudges my back gently towards the gate. “Let’s go inside?”

We enter and it’s even louder now. I see people like my mother hugging a fellow sister, people like my father meeting a friend’s son who’s visiting for Ramadan. “Mashallah, you are studying in California?” I overhear. “I hear their schools are excellent.”

“The masjid got mad upgraded,” Ahmed says.

“I noticed.”

We squeeze our way through the bodies.

“It’s still cramped though,” I say.

“That’s cause people are dumb and crowd at the entrance when they see their favorite uncle,” he says back to me. “It’s better once you get—” he ducks between a group of teenagers who are acting cooler than they are.

They glare at me as I pass.

“What did you say?” I shout at him.

“Just wait,” he says louder. “I was just saying—” The sound cuts as he disappears between two backs that close in before me. I try to walk around them, but there’s a sister there, and I don’t want to touch her accidentally. I tap the backs, but they only look after I give a little poke. I smile meekly. They let me through.

Thankfully, I spot Ahmed where the alley wall ends, in the backyard. I rush to catch up to him. “Sorry,” I say, randomly out of breath. He’s talking to an uncle who has a box of dates in his hands. I look around as I wait. It’s much less crowded in the backyard, but still just as loud. Ramadan lights pervade through the walls, collecting in bunches messily, ending on the awnings over the benches. I watch a father sit with a toddler on his lap who’s playing with a yellow and red wooden toy. The father looks bored, or he’s thinking, I can’t tell. His head suddenly rotates in my direction, and we make eye contact. I feel something sting under my ear.

Ahmed touches my back gently. “This is Inzamam,” Ahmed says to the uncle, and I turn to them gratefully.

“Assalamualaikum,” I say to him.

The uncle smiles, revealing gray and black teeth. “Ramadan Mubarak, wa alaikum as-salaam. Are you new to the community?”

“He’s just visiting,” Ahmed says. “He comes from North Carolina. Do you think we can get chaat before the Athan?”

The man shrugs and hands us each a date. I’m from North Carolina now? Is that my legacy? He says salaam one more time, then continues on his rounds, as I question my identity.

“That’s uncle Ahsan. He basically runs the masjid now. The board is useless.”

“Why didn’t you say I’m from here?” I ask.

“Long story, man.”

“Tell me. Is that who you think I am now?”

“No.” Ahmed rolls his eyes. “I mean, you’re a traitor for breaking our college promise, but that’s not why. Your mom is just kind of controversial here.”

My face scrunches. “Controversial?” I had thought she was loved, from Miguel #2.

“Dude.” Ahmed is staring at my feet. “Did you not—?”

I look down and see socks on his feet. I do a survey of legs, and find socks and bare feet on the carpet, but no shoes.

“We pray here, dude.”

“Shit. Sorry. I—” I immediately take off my shoes and hold them in my hand. The people behind me are slowly pushing into me as the backyard becomes more congested. I hold my shoes close. “Sorry,” I say to Ahmed, both for wearing the shoes but now also for lodging it between our bodies.

“It’s fine.” He sighs. “I’m just hungry.”

“Me too,” I lie. “Sorry for cussing too.”

He flashes a half smile at me, murmurs, “Whatever,” then looks the other way and sighs. “This line is long as hell.”

“Oh, I didn’t realize we were—”

The athan starts and I’m plunged underwater. My voice then softens into breath. The word of Allah is sharp as it enters my ears; the voices around me become murmurs, then silence.

Everyone around me is shuffling into a formation, but all I can do is stare at the evening sky, dark blues swallowing burnt oranges, and reds. The clouds from earlier have since dispersed. The remaining wisps drift as if they sway. The faith I’d held floats overhead. The faith was once inside of me.

I’m jostled around. Left to right to left again. A line forms in front and behind me. I feel tiny, and then for a moment, the athan hits a certain pitch, and I am transported somewhere, outside my body, where everything is thin and mahogany brown. Then I come back.

My shoes are still in my hands. Uncles are staring. I realize I have maybe ten seconds before the prayer starts and I’m trapped; I run along the row like a little kid until I reach the fence next to the benches. A few elderly are sitting there, facing the Qibla. I hide my shoes under their seats. The prayer starts. My nose clears completely. I squeeze against the fence, passing each row until I find a place to stand. I pray without Wudu.

Prayer should be calming, but I worry incessantly about making the wrong move. It’s been at least a year since my last prayer, so what if I go for sujood instead of ruku’, or stand up on the second raka’at instead of sit? Then they’d know I’m an impostor. A Man Without Wudu: it must be a sin to pray in my unclean state. I look around periodically as the Imam recites to make sure I’m standing correctly. Their eyes look down at the floor, while mine probe up and around.

The first raka’at passes without any major hiccups. Now we’re standing again, and I recognize the Surah the Imam is reciting. The familiarity comforts me, though I forget its name. Allahu Akbar, he says, and I bow with everyone else, observing them. I notice my breath is synced with the person next to me, and the next too; our chests expand and release. Everyone is whispering something. Breathing the same air. Looking down in submission. Samiallah huliman hamidah, he says, and we go up. Allahu Akbar—my will dissolves. My movements are automated. My body sways and moves and whispers without resistance. Without thought, without ego, the barriers around me withdraw, and the world seeps in. It’s not I who moves. It’s not even an “us”. Allah says in the Quran, ‘The seven heavens, the earth, and all those in them glorify Him. And there is not a thing that does not exalt Him by His praise, but you cannot comprehend their exalting.’ Indeed, as I prostrate, I join a world in worship of its creator. Everything is worshiping Allah, the trees moving in the wind, the pigeons chirping, the clouds swaying overhead. And I am everything.

Then it pops, and I can’t remember what has happened, or how I’d felt. Car engines and sidewalk talking distract me. Now, I’m pushing the world out, trying to focus, and it doesn’t work. My breathing is uneven. An ambulance passes the masjid, the siren drilling into my head. I mime, until the prayer ends, I mime.

We say the closing salaams. Now it’s fear I feel. My will returns, and I don’t know what to do. Ammi, Abu, and Laila are still missing, and I’m no closer to finding them than I was this morning. And I can’t find Ahmed either. I’m lost, I’ve been lost for weeks. The crowd starts to line up for Iftar, while I’m still looking for Ahmed. I go to the entrance, then back to the backyard, then to the benches, where I put my shoes. Where my shoes are. Where my shoes were. Where did they go? I follow the fence until the wall. I follow the wall until the other wall. Perhaps Ahmed moved them. The sound of Bangla and Punjabi is invading my mind. I can’t think, or hear, or speak. Another ambulance’s siren cuts through the speech, thinning my brain into a jelly. I’m standing on the concrete now, it hurts my feet, and dirties my socks. My father calls my name, somewhere. I turn, I can’t find him, I need to. He’d know what to do. Before I left for college, he was looking for something in the closet to give me, digging through the same passport box I saw yesterday. There must be something in there. He couldn’t find it. He dropped me at the airport, it was silent in the car. I hugged him before security. He said he’d get it next time. He was proud, or perhaps still surprised I had gotten a full ride. I know the length of his beard, the place the car was stalled, but I don’t know what he wanted to give me, I don't know what it was. I have to look in the closet. I have to find my family again. Inzamam, he says, where did you go? Inzamam—

“Why do you look so dumb?”

I turn and it's Ahmed, trying not to smile.

“You’re talking to a wall.”

“I wasn’t talking,” I say.

“You were breathing mad heavy, like this,” and he huffs and puffs onto my face.

“I thought your voice was my dad,” I confess.

“Woah! Okay. This is a no daddy issues zone. Anyway, I got us food while you were hallucinating.” In his hands are two plastic plates with rice, lettuce, and a piece of chicken.

“Is that where you were?” I take a plate from him. “Do you have a fork?”

“Yeah,” he flashes a fork, “But let’s find a place to eat.” He walks me to the building. “Where were you?”

“Oh. I was looking for my shoes. Did you take them? I can’t find them.”

“Some uncle probably put them in the front, don’t worry.”

“I already looked there,” I say. We cut between a dad holding his daughter on her shoulders; she’s looking around. I wonder if she can see the end of this crazy line, filled with men, wrapping around the backyard and past the gate. “Where are all the women?” I ask.

“They put them in the basement when the masjid expanded,” Ahmed says, opening a back door in the house. “Come.”

I follow him into a dark room. “The basement?”

“Yeah, they have a separate entrance. Careful for the stairs.”

“That’s not fair.” We walk up. “Do you think someone put my shoes inside?”

“You know how it is. Sisters in the back.” He looks back and smirks.

“Sisters in the back!” I repeat, an old joke dating back to high school, still familiar.

“Sisters!” he says in a Desi accent. “Sisters in the back Inshallah.”

I chuckle. “So do you know where my shoes can be?”

“Wherever they are, we can look after we eat.” We come to a ladder leading to a hatch on the ceiling.

“Where are we going?”

“The roof.”

“Are we allowed there?”

He gives me a look and shakes his head. Then he starts to climb.

“Do you think we should look for the shoes here before we go up?”

“Dude.” He stops on the third rung. “Can you drop the shoes? Jesus. It’ll be fine.”

He continues climbing. I shrug. I follow him up.

<br>
The moon must be hiding. But it should be full in the middle of Ramadan. I was taught this in Lahore: Islamic months start and end on a new moon, with the middle peaking full. Then it will become new again; the full moon must wane. The new moon marks growth and change. Be like the new moon, not the full moon, my Imam used to say. Emptiness is potential. Hubris can only decline.

Ahmed hands me a fork. We’re sitting on the floor because there are no chairs, which I was not notified of when he told me to climb a whole ladder like we were back in middle school on the monkey bars. My white socks are already gray, and soon my gray sweatpants will be charcoally too.

“Thanks for grabbing this, man,” I say over the murmur of people talking in the backyard. “I wonder if there's still a line.”

“The masjid is doing some homeless thing for Ramadan.”

I look at him, prompting him to continue.

“They said anyone in need can come for Iftar and they’ll be fed.”

“Oh, that’s good.”

“Yeah, your mom started it a year or two ago.” As if sensing my anxiety, he says, “Look, Inzamam. I’m sure someone knows where they are. Don't worry.” He cracks his back. “But the program,” he continues, “I dunno man. You saw how long that line was. We barely have enough space for everyone. And it’s not like they really care about us, barring the few that have converted, they’re just here for the food.”

Instead of thinking of my mother and father, I’m thinking about the iftar line, wondering who was Muslim and who was homeless and came for the food. Each of them is in one of two groups: us and the intruders. Ahmed loves to think that way, but it isn’t his fault. Somehow, when Muslims come to America, they form the tightest of circles, closed to the outside. And to think we claim to come here to be free, so insular as we are.

“You know,” Ahmed continues, “Last Ramadan, they gave us two pieces of chicken. Now it’s only one. The program is just idealistic liberal BS, good on paper, but a mess in practice, no offense to your mom. Islam is a religion of moderation. How can we feed others when we can barely feed ourselves?”

“I’m sure you’ll be fine, man,” I say vaguely.

“But what happens when actual Muslims stop going to the Iftar because it’s not enough to break their fast? The masjid wouldn’t even be a masjid anymore, just a homeless shelter. And you know how the city is. People would worship Cardi B if it gave them biryani.”

“Isn’t going to the masjid its own reward?” He’s losing me.

“Obviously I’m going. Others might not is what I’m saying. And do you even go? You didn’t eat your date on the Athan, though everyone else was. You just put it in your pocket. Are you fasting?”

My eyes dart. I mumble, “I’ve been traveling, man,” hoping he doesn't dig further. I touch my pocket and find the bump. I place the date on my plate, all hairy with cloth fibers. Not that I won’t eat it.

Ahmed gives me a look of suspicion, then one of disgust when I eat the hairy date. “I’m gonna ignore that,” he says. “I just think all this extreme stuff is messing us up as a community. White people wanna kill us and we wanna kill them back, as if that doesn’t make them want to kill us more. I swear, just last week, there were ICE raids in Queens, which sucks, but—”

“ICE raids?” I ask.

“Yeah. ICE. Immigration and customs enfor—”

“I know what they are. I just didn’t know they were raiding here too.”

“Yeah. Again, I don’t condone it, I’m sure many of the people they’re detaining are refugees. But the protests were just as bad as the raids themselves. Someone punched a whole cop. I’m just glad they didn’t tear gas us. You know, we have it better than we think, being here.”

While Ahmed talks of moderation, as conservative Muslims do, I remember Samia again. I had told her about this masjid, how much smaller it was than the Raleigh masjid, and how much more packed. The Raleigh masjid has private basketball courts, a restaurant, even a whole school. I used to go there sophomore year spring, the last time I went to Tarawih. By junior year, I stopped praying, but I still believed. In my mind, I was still a practicing Muslim, just procrastinating, like Qiyamah was something I could cram for right before I died. I remember telling Samia all this because after our conversation, she made out with me for the first time.

“Inzamam.” The mention of my name brings me back to reality. “You know, you’ve been pretty out of it tonight.”

“Sorry,” I say.

“It’s okay, I mean I told you your family is gonna be fine. What are you thinking about?”

I shake my mind like an 8-Ball, to see if I should tell Ahmed about Samia or not. He still seems religious, maybe chill, albeit conservative. If I was a woman, it would be a definitive no, but Muslim men tend to have a soft spot for the sins of other guys. My brain flashes green. Signs point to yes, it says.

“Just my ex,” I volunteer.

“Ex?” I can tell he’s surprised, but it only takes him a few seconds to integrate it into my new image: I’m one of those guys who leaves home and does a bunch of Haram things. (Wait till I tell him about the weed.)

“Yeah. We just broke up. I’m still processing it I guess.”

“Name?” he requests, like he has a phonebook ready in his mind.

“Samia. It’s honestly my fault. We were gonna move back to Charlotte after graduation, do a whole trip through the Blue Ridge mountains right before that. But I wanted to come back home, it had been so long. I didn’t have a job, I didn’t know how long I’d stay, but I just wanted to come back and see. She just got really upset at me, saying her plans were ruined, and I don’t value her time, and it became an ultimatum, either to go to Charlotte immediately or break up. Maybe I was being petty, but I didn’t want to give her that.”

“She’s from Charlotte?”

“Yeah. I mean that’s a good point, how come she’s the one who gets to go home and I just follow her? She didn’t even want me to come here, not to mention she didn’t even consider—”

“Samia, from Charlotte? I think I know her. The wasian?”

“I mean, she’s half Pakistani, so—”

“Yes yes. Wasian includes Desis. It’s in the ‘Asian’. I think my dad went to school with her dad. Met her at a wedding, or something.”

I rub my temple. “What am I supposed to do with that information?”

“Sorry. Sorry, man. You know how it is, brown people knowing brown people. So she didn’t let you go to New York? When was this, a month ago?”

“You know, I really thought I was returning,” I say, and something inside me unfolds. “It’s something I lost with her—lineage, maybe, the feeling that I’ve come from something and will leave something else behind. Samia’s window of attention is a day, and that’s why we got along, because each day was new, untethered to the last and the next—I felt I could live with her, exist in my body, create something new—you know, growing up Pakistani, you always had to figure out what something meant. Like if I dressed the wrong way, it would reflect on my family for the rest of our lives. And they’d speculate on everything: my hobbies, even the way I talked, —everything I did factored into college, which determined my job, marriage, family, and retirement. With Samia, I could just exist. But graduation came, and I met her dad, and the passage of time began to take over me. Too fast, or too slow, I had no control, it drove me crazy. And I wondered where I was going. If I was to leave anything behind. Maybe I wanted to be remembered. I came home: I returned. I wanted, even just for a little bit, to be part of something larger than a day, larger than a person, a month, a square block. And I arrived, but didn’t return, as now my family’s gone, and no one in my masjid even knows me anymore. Maybe Jackson Heights isn’t really my home; I only lived here six, seven years, but then what is?”

I look up and count the few dim stars scattered across the sky, emerging in lieu of the moon.

“I didn’t ask to leave Pakistan, man. I could have stayed in Lahore for the rest of my life. Now I’m lost. Even more so, without Samia, without Ammi, Abu, Laila.”

Ahmed is picking at his lettuce salad. “Yeah. I feel you.”

I sigh. Venting to men sucks. I thought I killed it with that monologue, but what’s the use without a competent audience? A drop of water touches my cheek. It might finally rain.

“Sorry,” Ahmed says. “Never been good at these things. But you should stay with me tonight, while you wait for your family. I have a condo in Kips Bay, near Little India. You can have the living room.”

I nod nonchalantly, though inside I’m wondering where Ahmed got the money for a whole condo in Manhattan.

“I’m serious. I can tell you’re driving yourself crazy. Look, I’m sure my parents know something. I’ll talk to them. Your family probably just went for a quick trip upstate and forgot to tell you. And who knows, after you get your business done here, maybe you can make up with Samia again. Nothing’s permanent, Inzamam. It’s never as bad as we think.”

“Fine,” I say. “But if your parents don’t know anything, I’m raising hell.”

“Fair enough.”

Now I’m the one picking at my salad, the rest of my plate licked clean, my stomach still half empty. It’s getting dark now. Isha must be soon.

“Lettuce is a scam for real,” Ahmed says firmly.

I glance at him, a little annoyed for no exact reason. He’s staring at my plate.

“It’s cheap, has no nutrients, and Desis think they can put a tiny tomato on it and call it a salad. Complete scam. Probably the cheapest way to fill a quarter plate.” He points to my salad. “You know a few years ago they filled this part with chana? Now it has something that takes more calories to eat than it gives you. You know, you’re right, Inzamam. Things change, we grow closer, further away. All we can do is be along for the ride.”

A pigeon’s picking at a grain of rice that’s at my feet. “Where did this come from?” I ask.

“Pigeons can fly, Inzamam,” and somehow that feels like the last word.

We watch it strut around, picking at our scraps. Soon, the roof calms, the pigeon leaves, and dust settles on our bodies. Silence finds us, it surrounds us, the new night sky is watching overhead. The streets start to sound like running water. I see my mother on the sidewalk; she bursts into flames, and disappears. The smell of smoke reaches my nostrils; it blurs my eyes, it waters them; I blink, a tear escapes. Ahmed puts his arm on my shoulder. He pats it once, then twice, then leaves it there.

### 4
A part of Zahra had always wanted to escape. But only because she wouldn’t. She had accepted, long ago, that Lahore would be forever her home, and her mother would be forever her guide and guardian. No one and nowhere else mattered. She stayed so long in the bounds of this world that a shell had formed around her, and she let it. And she learned how to escape without breaking that shell, inside herself: her books, her studies, the sunlight that hit her desk in the late afternoons.

Now the shell has broken. Inzamam has torn it apart with his babbles and his colicking. Zahra, at once, has been exiled from the shelter she’d constructed out to a wilderness, the real world. Inzamam grows quickly, body morphing to an abnormally large head, babbles becoming *Ammu* and *Abbu* and one-syllable Urdu words. Zahra adapts with him. She learns to be present, to sigh and to speak, respond to stimuli. Sometimes she feels she had been the one born, that all her life she had walked on clouds and only now has she stepped foot on this earth where plums and apples grow, people bicker and love, and the sun rises only to fall again.

Without a daughter to feed and house, Zahra’s mother Aisha no longer needs to keep her position with Uncle Ravi. As soon as her benefactor’s children begin school again, she leaves to join Zain, Zahra, and Inzamam in their new home. She is given a room with a small balcony, with the expectation that she would retire. Instead, Aisha devotes her time to assisting Zahra, despite the family’s dissent. “Please, let me at least find a cook,” Zain begs her every few weeks, but Aisha refuses to share her domain with anyone else. A compromise is made. Zain will pay Aisha for cleaning the house, taking care of Zahra and Inzamam, and helping Zahra cook for all of them. And she is not allowed to work Fridays, without prior approval from them.

Though it’s the same work to Aisha, to Zahra it feels miles apart, as she is the one now ordering her around. Now, it’s she who can tell Aisha to have the food ready in thirty minutes while Inzamam is falling asleep. And it’s she who can ask her own mother to clean up the plates while she changes Inzamam’s diaper. Only a few years ago, Zahra would be scolded for not refilling the lota in the bathroom. Now she leaves spare tissues and diapers in the living room, dirty cups on the tables, and baby clothes everywhere—and to her surprise, her mother does not scold her once for it. She is only scolded when she throws the trash out over resting, or for not eating enough—“You have two people to feed,” Aisha reminds her every day.

The only time Zahra’s mother does not feel like her maid is the two hours before dinner, after Zain comes home from work, when they all sit in the living room together and catch up on their days. The news is on in the background. Aisha plays with baby Inzamam, juggling him on her lap, trying to make his limp legs stand straight. Zain and Zahra hold hands on the couch. It only takes twenty or thirty minutes for the right news story to come up for Zain and Aisha to begin their debates. Then, when they are debating whether Benazir Bhutto was involved with Murtaza Bhutto’s death, or on the future of Pakistan and India’s proxy war in Jammu and Kashmir, Zahra discreetly gets up and sets the table for dinner, cleans the kitchen and throws the trash. She checks back in periodically to see Zain mourning Bhutto’s progressive but pro-Western administration, or Aisha lecturing him on how she had witnessed this exact nuclear race thirty years ago in the Cold War, while she rocks Inzamam back and forth.

Zahra is reluctant to start watching T.V., seeing how it has captured her mother and husband. But the Cricket World Cup starts three months after Inzamam turns three, and as a Pakistani, Zahra has no choice but to follow it. She learns as she watches and listens to Zain and Aisha argue over the bowling order. When Pakistan wins against Australia and New Zealand, she celebrates. And by the time they place first in their group and advance to the Super Six, Zahra is glued to the screen too. She is taking notes on how many overs Wasim Akram bowls compared to Shoaib Akhtar. She is triple-checking the schedule every day, days in advance. Most of all, she follows Inzamam-ul-Haq, Pakistan’s star player who shares a name with her son, and within a week, she is claiming he is Pakistan’s best batsman of all-time, causing a ruckus with Zain and Aisha each time.

Inzamam sits in her lap while they watch, asking endless questions to her. “Which team do we support?” The one in green, Zahra responds. “Why the ones in green? I like the red one more.” Because those are the colors of our country, Pakistan. “Why can't we live in Zimbabwe instead, where they have red jerseys?” To this question, Zahra has no answer. She has never considered living somewhere else. And it is not out of patriotism; her country does not deserve her patriotism—it should never have existed, according to her mother, being a product of partition, which was a product of colonialism, the West’s meddling. She is right. Even its geography is unsound. Its Eastern border cuts straight through Punjab, while its Western border split the Pashtun people in half. And along with India, they have destroyed Kashmir, her mother’s homeland. Zahra knows Pakistan is opaque—murky, inconsistent, like rivers after rain. And its politics are eccentric, even with their newfound “democracy”, what with the dismissal of Bhutto, and now Nawaz Sharif’s nuclear race against India. All Zain and Aisha have done recently is complain of their country, and Zahra can’t argue, because they are correct. But then the cricket match starts; Inzamam-ul-Haq scores a six, and they all join in to cheer. Her mother and husband, the two biggest haters of Pakistan, become instead the two biggest haters of their enemies. And when Pakistan advances to the quarterfinals—while Zimbabwe doesn’t—even Inzamam stops questioning his country of origin. “I want to stay in Pakistan,” he says to Zahra, looking up at her. “And I like green now,” he adds, fully convinced.

Zahra wonders if her identity is not more complicated than his. She wonders, if she were born elsewhere, if she would have felt this way for it too. All this country is is circumstance: the place she happened to be born, the place her loved ones happen to live, the place with the culture and language she knows intimately. She did not consent to this world. It all came before her. She was born into an arbitrary nation, she wrestles with contradiction, as she inherits it. When the cricket team is good, when they reach the finals, she finds herself quick to pride. But pride is not belonging. Pride is not permanence, or destiny. Even as she wishes it to be.

<br>
Zahra watches Pakistan get blown out in the finals against Australia. And four months later, she watches as General Pervez Musharraf’s plane circles the Karachi Airport, unable to land, after the prime minister Nawaz Sharif closes the airport in an attempt to dismiss him for a Chief of Staff more agreeable to him.

The senior leadership of the military responds. They storm the airport with troops, taking back control of the airport and allowing their general’s plane to land with only a few minutes of fuel to spare. They arrest Nawaz Sharif and put him on trial. This is the beginning of the counter-coup of 1999, the end of Pakistan’s brief democratic period and the reintroduction of a military-led government.

The family watches the trial together, this time not in excitement but anxiety, even shame, as the rest of the world watches too. Zain and Aisha debate over the future of the country; Inzamam turns four; Nawaz Sharif is given a life sentence, negotiated down by the U.S. and Saudi Arabia to an exile. Zahra begins preparing to send her son to primary school, one year early, at her husband’s behest. Zain himself has become erratic, paranoid; he sleeps late, misses work deadlines, and rambles constantly to Zahra about the corruption in Pakistan, affirmed by Aisha too. “What is the use of trying in this country if everything can change tomorrow?” he says to her. Zahra tries to reassure him that they are safe and lucky to be in their position in Lahore. He doesn't listen. He takes money out of their bank and stashes it under the sinks in their house, in the coat closet, behind the basmati rice in the pantry. He clears the basement into a shelter with bags of dry dal and chana. The weekend before Inzamam starts school, Zain lectures him on how important education is, how this country might take all their belongings tomorrow, but they will never take his mind, and that’s why he must try hard in school.

And Inzamam listens, he turns five, Zain tutors him on math and writing every other night. The house is slowly filled with the air of expectation. Zain begins talk of emigration. Fantasies, Zahra calls them, hiding in projections of their son’s success, images of utopias outside of Pakistan. She does not like his dreams, the restlessness they bring to everyone. The two begin to argue in the mornings, after Inzamam goes to school, before Zain leaves for work.

Like one morning, when Zain sees a new stain on the beige couch he ordered just three months ago, and asks Zahra about it. Zahra says couches like that are inevitable to stain. Zain then accuses her of staining it. Zahra says she didn’t, but that this couch, which she did not want, is representative of his idealist attitude, how he’s always thinking, imagining, but never here. Zain says Zahra is scared of change, and that the stain is ugly. Then he leaves for work.

And another morning, when Zahra asks Zain to take out the trash while she does the laundry. Zain refuses, saying Aisha can do it after cooking breakfast. Zahra says it doesn’t take more than five minutes to take it out, and what is with his aversion to housework? Zain claims he always helps around the house, just look at their nice couch. The house has been in shambles since Inzamam was born, Zahra replies. One of us has a job, Zain says, and the other doesn’t, so maybe that other person should fix it rather than complaining. Then he leaves for work.

And four mornings later, when Zain sleeps in and Zahra barges into the room, complaining that he has no right to push Inzamam so hard while being so lazy himself. She says this because Inzamam has been stressing over his second grade science project, which has made Zahra stressed too, though Zain is unaffected as his son has hidden his anxiety from him. Zain, having just woken up, accuses Zahra of coddling their son, and using too much hot water and electricity. They argue about meaningless things as Zain shaves in the bathroom, as he gets dressed, and as he eats his breakfast. Then he leaves for work.

Each time an argument starts, Aisha retreats to her room, like a flock of birds fleeing before a storm. When Zain yells at Musharraf through the T.V., she doesn’t join in anymore. She spends long afternoons watching shadows stretch from the window onto the couch, escaping from the world outside. Zahra watches her, she wonders—but doesn’t ask—if her mother, too, feels trapped by marriage, as an idea, as a structure self-imposed. Neither of them knew what to expect from this five years ago. Neither of them are unhappy. Yet in the regularities of their lives, they fall victim to the worst kind of nostalgia: the fantasies of what-ifs. Zahra knows her mother imagines, if not every day then every week, what their lives would be like if marriage was never thought of, then believed in. If they would be happy together and alone, or would be poor, or both, or neither. They clean rugs and fold bedsheets without exchanging more than five words. They budget with Zain on the weekends, and alternate grocery trips, never addressing Zahra and Zain’s arguments, or Zain’s increasingly frequent lectures to his son. Then, one night, when Zain is out at dinner with college friends, and Inzamam is asleep, Aisha approaches Zahra in her bedroom, and tells her to turn off the light before she sleeps. Zahra nods and says good night. You should find a job, Aisha says softly. It would do you well. Then she eases the door shut. Neither of them mention it again. The next week, Zahra goes with Inzamam to his school and applies for a substitute teacher job. Two weeks later, her arguments with Zain stop, as she is out most mornings, and they are too tired to bicker in the evenings, especially not around Inzamam. They even stop watching the news. Peace commences, tentatively.

The job is good for Zahra, so good that she coins a new name for herself at work: “Eucalyptus Zahra”, named after the eucalyptus tree she adopts in the school’s front yard. It is the same Zahra from ten years ago—curious, unbounded, undisturbed—except instead of walking to school she walks her son, instead of taking notes she projects her voice in her class; now, she learns about history and natural science for herself and for her students, not either, but both. This is a Zahra who works and learns, not out of obligation, but desire—a desire lacking in her home life riddled with responsibilities and critiques. Eucalyptus Zahra picks up some administrative work. She helps with budgeting. She even sits in on meetings to discuss curriculum. And she begins staying after school to help with after school care, and gossip in the office with Seema, Saima, and Rahina. Then she comes home, and changes into Okay Zahra—Okay for when Inzamam refuses to eat anything but burgers, Okay for when Zain complains the roti’s undercooked, Okay for when Aisha tells her how to raise Inzamam. Okay Zahra says Okay, but is never resentful, because everything she doesn’t have at home she can find the next weekday in Eucalyptus Zahra. It’s only because of Okay Zahra that Eucalyptus Zahra thrives, and the family becomes content, or at least tolerant. Even Zain begins to warm back into her. Out of the blue, he says: it's been six years, I love you, we are getting old, let us have another child. Zahra almost says Okay, but she thinks of Eucalyptus Zahra, and tells him: No, not now, not yet, meri jaan.

<br>
Winter is ending in Lahore. The air is cool outside as Zahra walks home from work. She wears a light shawl over her shalwar kameez, enough to protect her skin from wind or from public eyes watching her. As she arrives at the gate, the blue Toyota pulls in, Zain in the passenger seat. He had stayed late at work today too. He’s been staying late often, ever since the house calmed down, and their lives became mundane.

“Assalamualaikum,” Zahra says to the driver after he parks. “Hello, jaan,” she says to Zain.

Zain comes out of the car and smiles. He waddles over to Zahra. “Here, take my briefcase,” he says.

“Why?” She takes it from him. It’s heavy, and hard to grasp, as if it’s filled with water.

“Does a good wife question her husband?”

Zahra slaps him on the arm.

Zain smirks. “Just kidding, jaan!” He goes back to the car, and digs up a few shopping bags and a wallet. “I just needed to get these things from the seat.” He takes the briefcase back, and pecks her on the cheek. “My Zahru is a working woman. Are you trying to go for a promotion as well, coming home so late?”

Zahra looks at the open blue sky. “It’s still Asr,” she says. “Not that late.”

“Well, make Dua that I am promoted soon,” Zain says, kissing her again, walking past her to the front door.

Aisha and Inzi are in the yard. Inzi, already seven now, is holding a cricket bat. Aisha jogs down from the far side and rolls the ball towards him slowly on the grass. He tenses up, prepares his shot. Left leg forward, bat pulled back on his right. Ball is inbound. Right leg forward, bat comes up—but he misses it point blank. He trips and falls down on his chest.

Zahra runs to him. “Are you okay, Inzamam jaan?”

“He’s fine,” Aisha says, picking up his bat.

“I’m fine,” Inzamam says, face in the ground.

“Aiy-hai,” Zahra says.

Zain catches up to them, trying not to laugh while Aisha helps him up.

“Here,” Aisha says. She hands Zahra the cricket ball. “Bowl for me. I will guide his arms.”

Zahra bowls too hard. Aisha and Inzamam cower out the way.

“Not overhand!” Aisha yells. “You could have killed us.”

“Here,” Zain says to Zahra. “Take my briefcase.” He takes the ball from Zahra, and bounces it lightly along the floor. Aisha guides Inzamam’s arms. The bat makes a clicking sound when it hits the ball.

“Nice job!” Zain says. Aisha pats Inzamam’s back, and Zahra retrieves the ball.

Zahra and Zain take turns bowling for Aisha and Inzamam. They catch up on their days. Aisha had to cook dinner with tomato base instead of yogurt, since the yogurt expired early. The cricket ball gets lost in the far bushes, and the four of them look for it together. Zain finished a website for his client today and is now waiting on their feedback, since they are in Australia. They find the cricket ball. Zahra asks Inzamam how school was. He says that it was fine. She asks if he likes his teacher. He says his teacher’s fine too. Aisha asks if his friend at school took his lunch again. No, Inzamam says, but I gave him half, it was nice to eat something this time. He smiles at Aisha. She pats him on the head. Good job standing up for yourself, she says.

Zahra hasn’t been spending time with her family. Most days, she stays late at the office working, gossipping, watering the plants in the front. She arrives home right before dinner. Sometimes she works on the weekends too. In her absence, she’s watched Inzamam get close to her mother. The two spend all their time together on weekday afternoons and even the weekends, reading children’s books, playing with the toys, or running around outside. Zahra feels left out, but it isn’t a simple thing for her. She needs her days out to appreciate her domestic life. Distance, separation fortifies her love. She knows, if she spends her days at home, she would come to loathe it again. She can’t be just a housewife. Raising a child has changed her life, it gave her meaning. It consumed her too. For years, in that house, she was a ghost. Only now is she whole again. Only now can she learn, grow, move, walk, love again. It isn’t jealousy she feels, watching Aisha laugh as she holds Inzamam, who’s grasping the bat backwards, edges out. It is only that feeling that visits now and then, that acute awareness of the passage of time, of meaning being created, meaning being discarded, of change. Change in the form of growth. Change in the form of decay. Change in love being given and taken away.

Now Zain is talking of politics again. He hands the cricket ball to Zahra and takes the briefcase. He tells her how Musharraf has endorsed the United States invasion of Afghanistan, and how his liberal reforms have angered the left and the right. Somehow, in this year’s elections, the liberals gained majority in parliament, and now Musharraf has been trying to pass a term extension for himself and legitimize his presidency in retrospect.

“Jaan, can you please stop talking about this?” Zahra says. She throws the ball gently at Inzamam.

“Harder, please,” Aisha says, tossing the ball to Zain. “I think he can handle it now.” She winks at Inzamam.

“We need to leave this country,” Zain says as he bowls.

“Jaan, please.”

Inzamam misses.

“We have no future here.”

Aisha tosses Zahra the ball.

“I love Pakistan,” Zain says. “But we need to think what is best for Inzamam.”

Zahra looks at Zain. “What is best for Inzamam is staying where he was born.”

“How? Inzamam does not want to be here.”

“Yes he does. He loves Lahore.”

They turn to look at Inzamam and Aisha. Both are silent, faces blank. “Are you going to throw the ball then?” Aisha asks, impatiently.

<br>
“Can you believe him?” Zahra says to Aisha as they walk up the stairs. “It never ends with him.” Her mood has soured to purple in just the last fifteen minutes.

Aisha stops and turns to her. She pauses, as if reading something on Zahra’s face.

“What?” Zahra asks.

“Have you prayed Asr yet?”

She shakes her head.

“Go pray. Then put your shoes back on. Meet me in the lawn.”

When Zahra comes downstairs, Aisha is wearing her dupatta over her head, and she takes them on a walk around Defence. They pass a cinema, a shopping center with restaurants, shops, and a bank. The sun grows weak as it sets, as they walk, and the roads begin to reflect red and orange from brown, with shadows cascading everywhere. They cross a road and reach a series of buildings gathered around a square, people Zahra’s age walking around with books, jeans, and backpacks.

“Is this LUMS?” Zahra asks.

Aisha nods. “They have just added an undergraduate program for computer science and economics.”

Zahra imagines herself among them. Meeting a boy, a fellow student here, studying and sitting on benches together in the late afternoons, acting like they’re not in love. Thinking of history, not diapers and rugs. Of art, not masala.

But Aisha walks past everything. She walks all the way through the campus, trespassing around a building, until they reach a narrow canal.

“Are we allowed to be here?”

“Come, sit.”

“Where do I sit? I’ll get my shalwar dirty.”

“Just squat.”

They squat. Zahra surveys the scenery. The water is brown, with sparse vegetation on both sides. In the distance, flocks of trees spread outward, as if anticipating the coming spring. The sun will set soon. Even now, the sky glows, color stretching across the horizon.

“Perhaps Inzamam can do his undergraduate at LUMS,” Zahra says, “When he grows older.”

“Are you afraid of leaving Pakistan, Zahra?”

Zahra glances at her mother. “Amma, please. I was just complaining about Zain. He won’t talk about anything else.”

“You don’t like that?”

“Of course I don’t like it. I don’t want to leave. This is our home.”

“Your parents are not even from Lahore. We are not even from Pakistan, we are from Kashmir. You are not a Pakistani, Zahra.” She breathes in and out, squints at the horizon. “I was alive before Pakistan even existed. This country is nothing.”

Zahra watches the reflection of the sun in the still water below. “It’s still my home,” she says.

“Let me tell you,” Aisha continues, “About when I left Muzaffarabad.”

“You told me already this.”

“Did you know I did not want to leave? It was my Ammi and Abu who made me go, for my future they said, like the future I told you to marry Zain for.”

“And what a future this is.” Zahra is surprised how ungrateful she sounds, but right now she doesn’t care.

“I did not see the future they spoke of either, Zahra. I only saw a past and present I would leave behind.” Aisha’s voice is calm. “The partition had just happened. I was barely a teenager. My parents knew what Kashmir’s future held. They found a British school still running for me to study in, in Lahore. I thought that if I left, the family would break apart. And why wouldn’t we? We had only lived in the wake of those mountains and rivers that nurtured us. We were nothing without them, jaan. Yet I followed their advice. And immediately I was lost. Lahore was so loud, so crowded, everywhere. The mountains that protected me, the water that nurtured me, they were all gone. I was so raw, so naked without my home. So fragile, in Lahore.”

“You regretted coming here?” Zahra asks, allowing herself intrigue.

Aisha looks down and rubs her chin. “My mother and father died before I could come home, from a protest against accession to India. I could not even go home for the Janazah because of my exams. Uthman uncle came into my life then. I was beginning to realize I had no choice but to stay here, though I did not want to believe it.” She purses her lips. “I would have married him, if I could have admitted it to myself.” She pauses. “Hm.”

I would have gone back if it were me, Zahra thinks. “So you wish you did not stay?”

“Of course I didn’t, Zahra. The Kashmir today is not the same as back then. Even Lahore has changed. Everywhere. This regret you talk about, it is for young people who think they can stop the tides from turning, the sun from setting down. I do not regret anything, except that I had not accepted Allah’s will earlier in my life.” She picks up a pebble from the ground. It crumbles into dust. “Without those mountains, those rivers, we were nothing. No. We were those mountains. We were the rivers, those hills that built us up. So when we left, we froze them, and stashed them in our hearts. You do not understand, jaan. You cannot leave Lahore. You are Lahore. Even if you move somewhere else, even as it changes, it will stay intact inside your heart.”

“Perhaps,” Zahra says.

“Everything changes, except for us.”

Zahra is silent. Her feet begin to tingle from squatting.

“Just talk to your husband. See where he is coming from. I am telling you, Zahra, you must not reject change, because change will happen to you no matter what. Just think about it, jaan. Or do not think, just pray Istikhara. Then listen to your heart. Promise me.”

“Why can’t you talk to him? He’s the one who is so stubborn, anyway.”

“Zain is not my child.”

“I’m not a child either,” Zahra says, picking at a loose thread on her shalwar, watching the dirt disappear into the shadows of sunset. “This place is so ugly.”

“This canal drains into Ravi River in the South.” Aisha points to the left. “Ravi River, north, goes to the mountains of Kashmir.” She gestures with her hand, as birds flee the trees for the sky. “South, it finds the coasts of Karachi, the ocean, the rest of the world.”

All of a sudden, Zahra is struck by the magnitude of the Earth, its scale, its ambition. “Everything is connected,” she whispers to herself. Her feelings, so grand three minutes ago, now feel so trivial. She feels guilt from her hubris. She feels insignificant.

“Can we ever leave anything in an earth that is so together?”

The sun sets over this tiny canal, flashing red, and the water that looked once still, once humble, seems to ignite.

“So you want to leave Pakistan?” Zahra asks.

Aisha shakes her head. “You may. But I am meant to die in Lahore.” She laughs. “Dirty, busy city that I’ll be buried in. The soil is so flat I might not even fit under!”

“We’re not leaving you, Amma.”

“Nonsense, Zahra. I will be dying soon. You must not take me into account.”

“Dying?” Zahra scowls. Her mother is being dramatic again. “What are you talking about? You are barely seventy. You are healthy.”

“My time on this Earth is coming to a close, jaan, I know.” She watches the sunset, now brilliant, the colors reflecting in her eyes. Zahra’s feet are almost numb from squatting. She feels something vibrating underground, though it could just be the nerves on her feet. The water dims.

“Come,” Aisha says. “It is getting dark, and my legs are getting weak.” She gets up, with Zahra’s help. “Squatting is Sunnah, you know.”

Zahra follows Aisha. But she cannot take her eyes off the water, the way it glows so faintly, yet so truly, as if it knows the sun will soon extinguish and leave it alone in the dark.

<br>
Aisha dies the following year. The doctor asks Zahra if she displayed any pain or symptoms, but if she did, then she had hid it. Typical of her to withhold, Zahra thinks, to neglect her own health. Perhaps she chose death, resigned over fighting back. Perhaps she thought she was helping the family, or thought herself insignificant. Zahra bawls every night after Inzamam goes to sleep, how dare she, she says into her husband’s chest. How dare she leave us alone like this, blinded and lost.

The eucalyptus tree becomes infected with fungus. Zahra quits her job. She spends her mornings crying over wet dishes, her afternoons staring at the grass in their lawn. Everything she did that she did not want to do, she did for her mother. Zain was for Aisha. Inzamam, even, although she loves them both. This house, this life that’s bound to her, is now left untethered without purpose, without devotion, without cause. Things once trivial become complex beyond Zahra’s reach: listing groceries, speaking to her in-laws, beating dust out of the rug. Zain starts to cook in the evenings when Zahra cannot get up. Zahra sits on her bed, staring at the wall. A question enters and settles in her mind: what is she living for? If her mother has to die, why does she get to live at all?

And yet, it hits Inzamam worse. His teachers call, asking what has happened to their once most diligent student. He doesn’t finish his final projects, Zahra has to turn them in for him. Zain grows concerned as Inzi’s depression leaks from the spring through the summer towards the fall. “When will he be back to normal?” Zain asks Zahra. “It is almost time for him to start his fourth year.” Zahra doesn’t argue. She doesn’t tell him that there is no normal to return to, that their son’s middle school placements are the least of their problems. Instead, she stays quiet and wallows with her son, who understands. They spend the long, hot summer days watching T.V., sorting Aisha’s remaining belongings, sitting in the lawn. Sometimes Inzamam practices bowling against a plastic wicket, and sometimes Zahra bats. Sometimes she misses on purpose, or hits the wicket with her leg, pretending it was the cricket ball. Sometimes she runs to him and puts him on her shoulders, and chants his name over and over again. Sometimes Inzamam smiles, and Zahra kisses him on the cheek. And she thinks of how Inzamam will turn nine soon, and become too big for her to hold. She finds her husband in the bedroom that weekend, folding their laundry in silence. She finds him in the closet the day after, trying to fix the vacuum. She finds him in the kitchen chopping onions with a recipe book at his side. Gray hairs have found his scalp. He grows wrinkles, as Zahra does. We are aging, Zahra says to him in bed, we live in the shadow of death. Yet we live, Zain says. Not only have we lived, but we’ve created life. And though Zahra does not stop mourning her mother, she starts to locate the corners in herself that can fit something more. These corners do not hold life’s secrets, nor do they give her answers, but in them, she creates: a sketch of the terrace before the grass, a journal of memories, a throw blanket to cover the stain on Zain’s couch. She starts to cook again, and ruminates on having a second child. Our vacancies are not filled by ourselves, she thinks, but by the things we create and love. This life is one untethered. Each road must lead to death. Yet we move, and make, and love, unparalyzed.

<br>
Zahra is praying Fajr alone today. These early mornings in darkness have become her grace in this summer’s terrible heat. She swears it gets hotter every year, or maybe it’s that this is the first summer she’s been pregnant, and so motionless. Her stomach has become so large that now she prays on a chair. Even her feet have outgrown her shoes. If it's change she wanted, pregnancy has brought it. She says her taslim and leans back, whispering dhikr, thinking of her mother. It has been almost a year and a half since she died. It will never be normal again, but these days, it’s been bearable. Zahra's eased back into housework. Inzamam finished his fourth year and sits around in the summer mornings, plays cricket with the neighbors’ kids in the afternoons. Zain, when not helping at home, has been pouring himself into his work. Life has resumed. Yet their big house still feels empty without Aisha. Zahra rubs her stomach, hoping her daughter will bring light into the house. Laila, she will be named, after the night. For the darkness she was born in, the shadows of Aisha’s death.

With Aisha’s past wishes, Zahra prays Istikhara. Then she recites the Dua, naming the prospect of emigration that’s occupied her mind. With a new child on the way, Zain has been pushing the case to move to America even more. He wants to apply for jobs at the end of the year, then for a visa in the spring. Let me think, Zahra told him when he asked. I love you either way, he told her back.

Twilight has begun. The sun will rise soon, and the living room will shine. The heat will become unbearable by breakfast time. Then Zahra will have to go back to her bedroom and sit under their AC. For now, though, she can relax on her favorite chair, and watch the shadows shrink from the couch.

“Amma?”

Zahra turns. She sees Inzamam hovering behind the couch, wearing his classic curious face. He yawns.

“Kya kar ho Inzamam? It’s not even six o’clock.”

Inzamam slaps the couch, making a heavy sound. He slaps it again, in a different spot. “You’re praying Fajr, Amma?”

“I was praying Istikhara. Fajr is over now, jaan, look. The sun is starting to come.”

He looks past Zahra out the window, into twilight. He slaps the couch again.

“Inzamam, please.”

“It makes a different sound if you slap it in a different place.”

“Yes, jaan, thank you. Can you go back to sleep? Otherwise you will be tired at cricket again. And you will become upset if you don’t play your best.”

Inzamam shakes his head and slaps the couch again. He smiles to himself.

“Beta?”

“Okay okay, Ammi, just one minute.”

“What do you think of moving to America?”

Inzamam takes his palm off the couch and burrows his eyebrows. After a few seconds, he perks. “Okay!” he says.

“Huh?”

“Kobe is in America. I want to see him.”

“Who is Kobe?”

“He plays for the Lakers.”

“Who is Laker?”

Zain walks into the living room, yawning. “What is going on here?”

“We’re talking about Kobe,” Inzamam says.

“Who is Kobe?” Zain asks.

“He’s a Laker,” Zahra says.

“He plays in California,” Inzamam adds.

“A friend of yours?” Zain asks. “I want to go to New York. Bari-mamu says they have the best Italian food there.”

“But the Knicks suck.” Inzamam pouts.

“Bari-mamu hasn’t even been to Italy,” Zahra says.

“When you know something is the best, you don’t have to try out everything else.”

“Bari-mamu doesn’t even live in New York. He lives in New Jersey.”

“When you know something is the best,” Zain repeats, “Then—wait.” He stares out the window. “Did I miss Fajr?”

“Yes you did,” Inzamam says. “I did too.”

“Why didn’t you wake us up?” Zain demands to Zahra.

“First of all, Inzamam is eight years old. Second of all, I woke you up, Zain.” She gives him a look. “You just didn’t wake up.”

Zain sighs. He plops himself down on the couch.

“Jason Kidd is in New Jersey,” Inzamam says. “He’s pretty good.”

“Where are you learning this, beta?” Zahra asks.

“I was working last night again,” Zain says as he looks at the floor.

“My computer game, NBA Live,” Inzamam says. “Jason Kidd is on the front.”

“I am trying to see if my job will transfer me to America. Or find a new American job.”

“That's nice, Inzamam. Why don't you just choose one of them Zain?”

Inzamam walks around the couch and lies on his father’s lap. Zain takes a deep breath, then rubs his eyes and reclines, running his fingers through Inzamam’s hair. The sun rises onto their faces in a movement Zahra can’t detect, no matter how closely she watches it.

“Abu?” Inzamam says.

“Yes jaan?”

“When we move to America, can we see an NBA game?”

“Who said we’re moving to America?” Zain raises his eyebrow at Zahra.

Inzamam stretches and turns onto his side. Zain adjusts his hand onto Inzamam’s ear.

“I was just asking him what he thought,” Zahra says. “Now he won’t stop.”

“But not the Knicks,” Inzamam says. “I don’t want to see the Knicks. Please.” He yawns.

“Ok jaan.” Zain looks down at him. He smiles. “You know, Inzamam, when you were a baby, you used to cry when you were tired, rather than sleeping. It was very annoying. But then I found out, if I just put my hand on your ear like I am now, you would fall asleep instantly. I remember thinking it was like a button that put you to sleep. But when I took my hand off the button, you would wake up and cry again.”

Inzamam starts to breathe slowly. Zain and Zahra look at him, then at each other, then back at him.

“Allah,” Zain says. “I’m stuck.”

Zahra giggles.

Zain tilts his head back. “How will I make up Fajr like this?”

“Just don’t move your hand!”

“I don’t know how I will deal with two of these betas.”

“Ready or not, jaan, she’s coming.”

“Well,” he sighs, “At least Inzamam is on board with emigrating. He does not seem attached to staying here anymore.”

“Of course he doesn’t. He looks up to you, Zain. He will entertain anything you talk about so much.”

“I don’t talk about it that much!”

Zahra raises an eyebrow. “Just be careful. Inzamam is insecure. Even losing at cricket makes him sad the whole week. I don’t know what going to another country will do for him.”

“He’ll be fine, jaan.” Zain closes his eyes. “We’ll be fine.”

Zahra touches the fabric of her chair and stares at the throw blanket she knitted last year in mourning, folded on the couch. It covers the stain well, and the green color complements the beige. This house is filled with her. All these things she’s made and done, all the ways in which she’s loved.

“Maybe it’s me,” Zahra confesses. “I’m scared. I don’t want to lose this home we’ve built, all for an idea, a bet. Sometimes I wonder where life is meant to lead us. I was naive when I was younger, I didn’t think much of my future, I thought everything would work out if I just worked hard. Now I know how our parents felt. With a world a wilderness, and yet we must make sense of it for our kids. Now that Aisha is gone, I have no compass anymore. It’s just me and you.” She pinches at her armrest. “I don’t know how she did it, the fear she must have felt every week, that if she made one mistake everything would be destroyed for her daughter, for me. Perhaps we will not win the visa lottery, or you won’t find a sponsorship, and everything will be the same. But you’re so optimistic, it feels it must happen. Zain, did you ever think my mother was in love with your father? She talked about him so much before she died, I don’t know.”

Zahra sighs. Her chest is tight. Sunlight enters her eyes. Time passes and it unsettles her. There’s no escape from change.

A snore escapes from Zain. His head is bobbing to the side. Zahra smiles to herself. She watches Inzamam’s chest rise and fall, under his Abu’s embrace. They’re glowing in the sunlight. Everything is quiet and soft. Zahra’s chest loosens, and inside herself, she finds not courage, but love. She gets up, takes the throw blanket on the couch, and spreads it over her husband and her son. Zain lies to the side, Inzamam snuggles into his arm, and Zahra thinks to herself: nothing of this world may matter after all, as long as I’m with my jaans.

### 5
The front door rattles with the cadence of three knocks from outside. I open my eyes and jolt up from Ahmed’s couch pillow. Six hard knocks follow. The door looks like it will be bashed in soon. Ahmed’s room door opens slowly. He appears a second later, waddling through the doorway, pulling the string on the sweatpants he just put on.

“I’m gonna tear this damn door down, asshole,” the voice behind the door says. So my prophecy of the bashing was true. I want to brag to Ahmed that I could tell from the cadence of the knocking that it was the kind of knock that would precede a kick, then a sledgehammer, but he’s busy unlocking the deadbolt.

“This damn thing won’t turn,” Ahmed says. He looks back at me.

“Lemme take a—”

More loud knocks, but only two this time, slow and deliberate. The knocker has had enough. It’s sledgehammer time.

“Okay!” Ahmed says. “I’m unlocking the door. Relax.”

“Who is it?” I ask him.

The door opens. Ahmed blocks the doorway. I can’t see who it is.

“Good morning,” Ahmed says to the person. He rubs his eyes. “Nice of you to show up.”

“I know you have something to do with this.”

“What are you talking about?”

“Don’t pretend you don’t know about my mom getting arrested.”

“Yasmine, what the hell? It’s eight in the morning.”

“Eight thirty. And shouldn’t you be up for work anyway?”

Ahmed turns back to me and gives me the kind of look the main character in a sitcom would give the camera when something absurd happens. Meanwhile, I’m thinking of the name Yasmine, how familiar it sounds, but I can’t put my finger on it.

“Yas, maybe I’m taking a sick day. And maybe I'll cough on you.”

“Don’t call me that.” Her fingernails are visible on the door frame, painted black. “Look, I just need the backup keys to Zahra’s apartment. Do your parents still have it?”

I stand up, roused by my mother’s name. Ahmed shoots me a look I can’t decipher.

“Who do you keep looking back at? You had a girl over last night after Tarawih?”

Yasmine’s arms push through the small gap between Ahmed and the door frame. There’s a brief struggle, but Ahmed relents and I make eye contact with Yasmine.

Now I remember her. From high school. She and Ahmed had a weird thing in senior year where they got really close as friends and everyone else could tell they had feelings for each other but neither admitted it because everyone knows senior year situationships are bound not only to fail but to embarrass both parties for believing they’re special enough to be the one to survive through the high school to college transition.

“Who the hell are you?” she says. She combs her hair back with her hands.

Yasmine used to wear hijab in high school, but I won’t comment on that because I stay out of women’s business. I wonder, though, if I’m allowed to look at her hair now, as her hands caress the strands and then plop them back down. It feels wrong to watch. What if she goes back to wearing the hijab again, remembers me, and feels uncomfortable that I stared in retrospect? This then may be the last time I’ll get to see her hair unless I marry her (and while she seems like a great woman, I don’t think that would be fair to Ahmed). All things considered, I figure it’s not worth the risk, so my gaze lowers from her hair to her chest, which triggers a code red. I’m panicking now, but it's creepy to keep scanning her body top to bottom, so I dart my eyes quickly out of the danger zone and stare at the doorknob’s gold handle, which is surprisingly quite shiny even without a clear source of light pointing at it. (Ahmed’s windows look South, which means the morning sun hasn’t appeared yet but will by ten or eleven, depending on how tall the buildings across the street are.)

“This is Inzamam, from high school,” Ahmed says, likely a bit vexed at my silent fidgeting. “You don’t remember him?”

Yasmine’s face relaxes as our gazes meet. “Oh, Inzamam? Yeah, wow, long time no see.”

“You can call him Inzi,” Ahmed says for me.

I wave to her instead of taking the risk of going for a hug or handshake. I notice a backpack strapped to her shoulders.

“Wait, you're Zahra’s son, right?”

I nod. I yawn.

“Wow, what a coincidence!” She smiles, then focuses. “Do you know where they are?”

I shake my head.

“I haven’t been able to get in touch with them. See, they’re—”

“Wanna sit down?” I ask, though I’m really begging, because we’re standing in an odd formation, Ahmed near the door, Yasmine with his back directly to him, me on the other side near the couch, and it’s making me anxious, among other things.

She breathes out. “Yeah. Actually that would be great. Do you have any water?”

I scurry to get some water even though this isn’t even my place. I realize I’m thirsty but something stops me from getting water for myself. “Right cupboard,” Ahmed says as he walks by the kitchen back to his room, followed by, “I’ll be back.”

Ahmed had woken up for suhoor today. I remember hearing the door creak from the living room. An egg cracked, the pot sizzled, I listened to the microwave and the toaster oven as I drifted in and out of sleep. He didn't try to wake me up to start my fast. I didn’t know why. In my half-awake state, I convinced myself that I was fasting anyway. It could have been spite against Ahmed assuming I wouldn’t be the type to fast. Or it was guilt for living it up in college while my family might have needed me, now that they’re gone. I was too tired to tell. All I could think of as I fell back asleep was the moment I stopped fasting, last year, after I fell asleep from exhaustion on my desk at my internship. I came to believe that fasting wasn’t worth it. I was alone in Richmond. No one fasted with me. No one woke up with me for suhoor. And no one was watching me anymore, except my boss. I followed him instead.

A croissant peeks out at me from its paper bag next to the fridge. I place it on a small plate as an appetizer, a garnish. Yasmine makes an O with her face when she sees it.

“Croissant??”

“Yea.”

She eats it in three bites, four if you count the first survey bite to make sure it's edible.

“Thanks. I took a six A.M. flight over from Boston so I didn’t get to eat. I was starving.”

I can tell, I don’t say to her. Instead I ask, “You’re not fasting?”

She raises her eyebrow at me. “You want me to tell you that I’m on my period?”

My jaw clenches. “Sorry,” I mumble through my teeth.

“Just kidding, I’m not. I just told you I’m traveling. Bozo.”

“Not sure if knowing you’re not is better than knowing you are.”

She giggles, almost childishly, which catches me off guard. “You’re funny. Are you fasting?”

“I think so. I don’t know. I guess I should. I mean I might as well.”

She raises an eyebrow at me, then lets it back down. “So you really don’t know where your family is? I need to get in touch with your mom. It’s kind of urgent.”

I lean back and take a deep breath. Her shoulders relax in response. I catch her up on the events of the last week: my mom ghosting me a week ago, me thinking I did something wrong but being too stubborn to cancel my flight, coming home to an empty apartment—“Well, really that's it, I guess,” I say. “Yesterday I chased a fake lead for a Miguel my mom had said was staying with us. Also I don’t have phone service cause we’re on cricket now but I don’t know where my dad put the new SIM cards. Like I said, I have no idea what's going on.” I look up at the door. I stare into the mirror next to it, eyeing the design on the armchair that precedes the kitchen arch. “Ahmed said he'd ask his parents though,” I say, returning to optimism, as I do.

“And?”

“Oh, he'll probably ask them after work.”

“After work? This isn't a fucking sleepover, Inzi. How are you not freaking out?”

I am freaking out, I want to say. “I dunno. The lights were on when I got home, and there's still haleem in the fridge. Ahmed said they probably went for a trip and forgot to tell me. He said he saw them last week.”

Yasmine’s face broadcasts what would be terror if it was not so filled with disgust. “Ahmed!” she screams, with a fluent I-want-to-speak-to-the-manager accent.

Ahmed stumbles out in the same fashion he did a few minutes ago, this time tying a tie around his collar instead of sweatpant string. “What?” he groans.

“His family is missing and you’re spending time matching shitty colors together?”

“What?” Ahmed looks down at his shirt and pants. “Do the green and brown not match?”

“You look like you’re wearing camo. So can you call your parents?”

Ahmed sighs. “I see what's going on here.” He knots the tie and pulls it up. “Yasmine, you can project your anxiety onto me, but please don't project it onto him. His family is fine. Your mom will probably be fine too.”

“Cop-out.”

“I’m just saying, you need to rel—”

“Cop-out.”

“Yas, come—”

“Cop-out, and also I told you not to call me that.”

“Fine! Look,” Ahmed turns to me, “I didn’t want to tell you until I knew more, but I talked to my parents last night and they said they’re handling it. I don’t know the details, but—”

“So they’re not just traveling?” I ask, my breath light as if my lungs would break if they held too much air. “They’re actually gone?”

“Inzi, look, we still don’t know, so please—”

“Why didn’t you tell me?” I beg.

“I didn’t want you to freak out, Inzi, please understand. I’m sure there’s a reason for all of this. Look, I’ll call them on my way to work and iron it out. My parents are handling it.”

“Wow.” Yasmine gets up. “Look, we gotta go.”

“Who’s we?”

“You just lied to your friend from high school. You don’t have a say in this.” She looks at me. “You have your apartment keys, right? Please tell me you do. I need to get to your place.”

I nod stiffly, still afraid of taking anyone’s side.

“Oh, hell no,” Ahmed says. “You’re only gonna make it worse.”

“ME? YOU are the one who created this mess in the first place!”

They go back and forth. I try to determine, as they argue, if Ahmed had wronged me or not. Maybe he was right to calm me down. Or maybe I had a right to know more. But it’s hard to think while in the middle of a custody battle between him and his alleged ex.

The argument continues on.

“Always you and your agendas!”

“Oh, holy projection. I—”

“Hey,” I interrupt, speaking as calmly as I can. “I probably have to go back to Jackson Heights anyway. There were a couple boxes in my parents’ room I wanna take a look at. Maybe they have a clue.”

Ahmed looks at me. Now they’re both staring into my soul. He speaks. “Blink twice if you need help,” he says. He waits. He knocks his knuckles together. “Fine. Take him. I have to go anyway. But I’ll text you in a couple hours. Don’t let her get to you.”

“Oh whatever, just go for work.”

“This is MY apartment. You want ME to leave?”

They’re shouting again.

Yasmine stands up. “No! I’m leaving too! Actually, I’m leaving first!” Yasmine takes me by the hand and shoves me through the door. I try to tell her I left my toothbrush, but we’re already in the elevator. I guess they left that to Ahmed in the divorce.

<br>
We take the 7 back to Jackson Heights. I sit next to a puddle of off-yellow liquid while Yasmine gets the edge seat to my left. She places her bag on her lap. She pulls out her phone and scrolls. I watch her close and open Instagram four or five times. Soon the screeching of the tracks numbs the pulsings in my head, and I reflect. Yasmine and Ahmed certainly act like exes, whether they dated through college or not. I want to ask what happened between them. But I don’t know Yasmine like that yet. I could instead ask her how long Ahmed has had that condo and where he got the money for it. And why he chose such a crappy spot on the east side of midtown where all the transplants live. NYU students don’t know much, but they should know better than that. Unless his office is nearby. That would explain his late rising. None of this is verbalized, of course. Yasmine and I sit in silence, occasionally adjusting ourselves on the seat so our bodies don’t touch when the train jolts back and forth.

The train crosses Manhattan and reaches Court Square, emerging out of the tunnels and looking down onto the streets. I watch the Queens skyline between two commuters sitting across from me: brick buildings, empty warehouses, high-rises under construction. Graffiti appears around Sunnyside, as we snake around the tracks, then disappears again when we find Woodside. I love this city. I don’t even know why. I wonder what it is that creates affinity, this sense of closeness to a city I barely know and only lived in for six years. Perhaps big buildings, like natural wonders, pull you to them, make you circle and remember something sharper and more strewn with meaning than what had actually occurred. Reality escapes me in memory. There is no truth except in the forgotten, and I can’t forget Queens. I can’t forget the long walks I took home from school, listening to my Zune and thinking I was the only person in New York. My high school was in Elmhurst, near the mall, and sometimes I would walk through its Chinatown and stop for bubble tea at Panda Cafe, or Anda Cafe on Google Maps, because the P on the sign was actually a Panda and maybe that wasn’t good enough for big tech. I got an oolong tea and some taro fries when I had money, otherwise I just sat at a table and did homework until it got too busy and the staff told me to leave. I was the first to find this place, but other people began to come. I remember, in particular now, a hijabi girl who attended the anime club meetings at the corner table, occasionally. Somehow, she looks familiar in my head. She had the same nose as Yasmine, the same warm but light Hyderabadi skin tone. Is my memory just projecting the present onto the past? Am I being racist to Desis again? She loved One Piece. She swooned over Sanji, she disparaged Nami, maybe out of jealousy. It surprised me, not that a Muslim woman liked anime, but how she caught so much of the group’s attention when she spoke. After a month, she was effectively running the meeting. The president—a crusty white boy—and the treasurer—a short Vietnamese girl—tried many times to take control and observe the agenda. But the group kept looking back towards her to see if she had any objections, any questions, any thoughts on their plan for the next AnimeCon. By November or December, she officially was leading the meetings, and the president and treasurer just cuddled on the bench. Soon after, the hijabi disappeared. Maybe she was banned, or she lost interest. All I know is each meeting thereafter was smaller and quieter, and soon they never came to Anda Cafe again.

I look at Yasmine, trying to overlay my memory onto her face. She looks back at me.

“Next stop,” she says, waving her finger at me.

I raise an eyebrow. “How do you know where I live?”

“My mom came over a lot the last few years. I came along with her when visiting. I’m basically your sister’s bestie.”

“Bestie?”

She nods like it’s obvious. It occurs to me that I don’t know anything of these relationships. I don’t even know why Yasmine is coming with me.

“So we have something of your moms?” I ask.

“Your mom has my mom’s spare key. My mom left it with her when I moved to Boston, just in case anything happens. Cause she lives alone, you know, after the divorce. I need the key to get to her apartment and take care of things for her.” She looks back at her phone and mumbles, “I know where she keeps it, so don’t worry.”

“Do you think she knows anything about where my family went?”

“Inzi,” Yasmine says without looking up, “I am absolutely sure that my mom’s arrest and your family’s disappearance are linked. I’m seeing her tonight. I’ll ask her.”

“Thanks.” I smile at her but she’s still on her phone. “Can I ask you something?”

She looks up from the phone with a look of tentative consent.

“Did you like One Piece?”

Her nostrils flare.

“Did you show up to our school’s Japanime Club a couple times in Anda Cafe?”

Her eyes grow large with terror. Her ears fold back into her hair.

“Did you have a crush on Sanji and were jealous of Nami because of that?”

She grabs me by my shirt and pulls me towards her face. “Don’t ever accuse me of this again,” she says, staring me deathly in the eye. “I’ll forget you brought that up, and you’ll forget any of those false, stupid memories that you have. Capiche?”

I nod six or seven times in case it isn’t clear. She lets me go right as the train arrives at our stop. We walk down the stairs together, me still shaken up at our altercation, and yet just a little bit turned on.

<br>
My parents’ closet door won’t open. Yasmine is sitting on the bed behind me, playing with her mom’s apartment keys that she got from the key hooks in the hallway, while I open the door and grunt. And moan.

“You need help?” she says.

“No, I’m fine.” I pull again. It doesn’t budge. “I just opened it two days ago.” I’m realizing now I might need some help, but I said no already, so I must suffer alone.

“You said the lights were on when you got home yesterday?” she asks from behind me. She sounds like a detective, or like she thinks she’s one.

“Yeah. It was the night before,” I say, still struggling with the door.

“That’s weird…”

I pause and catch my breath. “Would it still be weird if we weren’t brown and compulsively saving on electricity bills because of the internalized scarcity from two centuries of British occupation and the trauma of the partition of 1947?”

She thinks for a second. “Objection overruled,” she says. “Hypothetical.”

I pull again.

“Hey,” she says, “Sorry for assaulting you on the train.”

I grunt. “It’s okay,” I say. “We all have embarrassing pasts. Ouch! What the hell was that?” I pick up what looks like her phone from the floor and stare back at her.

“I said sorry. Not ‘you were right’.” She takes her phone back, then faces the closet. She pulls the door open with one swing. Her grin reaches her cheeks.

“I weakened it.”

“Remind me not to ask you to open any jars anytime soon.” She rubs my back where the phone hit me. “Sorry. I forget how heavy phones are. So what are you looking for?”

I lift a few coats that had fallen off their hangers. “I dunno, but my parents keep all our important documents in two boxes here. Actually, speaking of assault, one time I looked through them and got beat even though I was almost thirteen.” I smile at Yasmine’s worried face to show it’s okay. “Abu is probably defensive about it because he keeps my video games here when I’m grounded.” I place the coats to the side. “Sorry. Abu was probably defensive about it because he kept my video games here when I was grounded. Anyway, if the passports are here, they’re at least not abroad. If not, I dunno, maybe I’ll find some travel itinerary.”

One of the boxes is gone. I look at the naked ground where it was just two days ago.

“What?”

“There’s a box missing. There’s two. I saw them just two days ago. I swear.”

“Are you sure, Inzi?”

I stare at the floor. I am so sure. There have always been two boxes, filled with documents and IDs and certificates, and there were still two when I arrived two nights ago.

“Inzi?”

I jolt up and march to the living room. She follows me. I look around the TV stand. I throw the couch cushions up then down. My stomach starts to churn, from hunger or whatever I’m feeling right now. I yank open each drawer in the couchside table. They make a shanking noise as they close. The remote is in the last drawer, on top of batteries and pens. I grab it and hold it up.

“Inzi, what is going on?”

“Someone was here.”

“What are you talking about?”

“Someone was here. I remember I left the remote on the couch arm when I was watching the news yesterday. Even if I didn’t, I know I was too stressed to consider tucking it into this drawer for whatever reason. That and the missing box, and the lights were off this time, did you notice? I didn’t turn them off. I wanted to keep the apartment the same. Someone came here yesterday, Yasmine, after I left, or this morning before we came.”

“Are you—”

“I’m sure, I’m fucking sure, Yasmine, I—” It pops into my head that I should look at the box that’s still left. I run back to the bedroom and open it up.

“Inzi, please, slow down, can we talk about this?”

Receipts. Utility bills. No passports, no IDs, not even our immigration papers, which I know they wouldn’t take unless they were fleeing something. Under five or seven or ten layers of useless papers are my mother’s hospital bills. From her surgery a few weeks ago. I flip through them and skim the discharge papers attached. There are so many words I don’t understand: atherosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia, coronary angiography, artery—actually, I know what an artery is. I turn to Yasmine for help. She looks terrified, or delirious, standing a couple feet away from me with her arms crossed and shoulders concave.

“Do you know what an atherosclerosis is?” I ask her.

“Inzi, you—” She pauses. “I studied political science, sorry. I can’t help. But—”

I turn back to the documents. I Google some things. I gather that the surgery had to do with blood supply. The surgery was successful, Alhamdolillah. Afterwards, they installed stents, which keep arteries open, according to Dr. Google. But now she has a million bills, a debt, a prescription for blood thinners. I pray that they got the prescription before they left to wherever they went. And that they paid the bills. The bills total to tens of thousands of dollars. Wait. It couldn’t be.

“Inzi, maybe we should take a break. We can talk about this over lunch.”

I’m pinching my chin. There's no way they fled the country to escape some medical bills. I must be going crazy. My stomach is hurting now. Everything inside me feels empty.

“Inzi, I can tell you’re stressed. Maybe we can talk this out one step at a time.”

My eyebrows burrowed, I turn back towards her, holding the discharge papers in my hand.

“You okay? Inzi?”

She’s playing with her mom’s keychain. Keys. I remember the keys. I run to the key hooks. Shit.

“Can you talk to me?!”

“The car is still here.” I imagine a windshield with twenty tickets. “There's no way they fled without a car. Unless someone dropped them somewhere. The airport? That would explain the missing passports. But I couldn't find mine either. Why would they take my passport? Where would they go?” My brain is firing in a hundred different directions. I feel like throwing up. “Do you think—”

My stomach lets loose a long, deep growl. We stare at each other as it wanes.

“—Do you think your mom might have dropped my family at the airport because they were fleeing exorbitant hospital bills after my mother’s surgery and then maybe the cops found your mom and arrested her for aiding and abetting fugitives?”

Yasmine’s eyes grow and sink back into her eyelids. Her eyebrows stretch so far forward that they look 3D.

I slide down the wall and collapse between my legs. Papers scatter around. I can't stop yawning and my stomach is growling again. All these pieces are driving me crazy.

Yasmine picks up the papers and looks through them. “You got all this from a hospital bill?”

“Passports are gone too,” I mumble from my hands.

“Yours too?”

I nod, unknowing if she can see my head or not.

“You need to eat, Inzamam. Your stomach is crying for help.” She pats my shoulder in sympathy. “How long have they been gone?”

“A week.”

“Okay. So let's take a step back and think about it. We can get lunch, an hour won't change anything. Then we can go to my mom’s place and search there too, for clues.”

She's probably just hungry, selfish as she is, only thinking of herself.

“I’m phasting,” I mumble.

“Huh?”

“Fasting. I can't eat. I'm fasting.”

“Did you even have Suhoor?”

I shake my head. My skull feels like it will cave in.

“Get up.”

I feel fingers under my tricep.

“Come on, Inzi, we’re going.”

“I fasting,” I whimper. I think of all the crevices in the apartment: the kitchen drawers, the dresser, the container of old mail—all ripe for digging.

“Look. I have an appointment to see my mom in a few hours, and I need to go home first, but I’m not leaving you like this. If you’re gonna do anything, you need to take care of your body and yourself first.”

My arms go limp in consent. I’m pulled up, I’m pulled through the hallway. I’m pulled to get my phone and keys. Everywhere I go, I am pulled. Everywhere, I’m taken, and I’m lost. We approach the front door, everything is always a door. The door creaks open and we jump back. A head appears inside the crack. The eyes settle on us. Then the mouth yells.

“BISMILLAH ya Allah,” it says.

I squint at the face. “B-Bushra Auntie?” I ask.

“Inzamam?”

The eyes scan right.

“Yasmine?”

Bushra Auntie squeezes through the doorway. She’s holding a keychain in her hand. I’m still surprised when she speaks accentless English while wearing the kurtis they’d wear back home. (She was born in Houston.) Her round face still shows shock.

“What are you two doing here?” she asks.

“I was—I’m looking for my family.”

“We were just gonna go,” Yasmine says.

“Sorry to walk in on this,” Bushra Auntie says. “I…” Her body relaxes. “I had just heard something in the apartment and I needed to check.”

I apologize to her. “I didn’t realize we were being so loud.”

“I didn’t know you were here, beta. And you too, Yasmine beti. Your family has been gone the last week.”

“Yes, I know. Ahmed told me he talked to you about it.”

She bites her lip. “Yes,” she says.

“Do you know what happened? You still live here right?”

“Yes beta. We’re downstairs. Unfortunately we don’t know. But Farhan Uncle and I have contacts in the police. We are working with them to get your family back. And they are making good progress. Inshallah this will all be resolved soon. You don’t need to worry.” She straightens herself. “Now that you are here, jaan. Do you have their ID? Any of them. It would help the police.”

I rub my temple. “Ugh, I couldn’t find anything,” I say. Some stuff is missing from the apartment too. It’s suspicious. You didn’t see anyone come in this morning or yesterday night?”

Bushra Auntie jiggles her head side to side. “No, beta. It’s okay. I’ll get your number from Ahmed and call you if we find anything. You said you’re leaving now?”

“Yes,” Yasmine says. “And I’m sure you know. My Ammi is in custody. You don’t have anything to do with that I assume?”

“No, of course not. Are you saying I do?”

“No, Auntie. Of course not.” She puts her hands in her pockets. “Never mind then.”

Bushra Auntie leaves. We exit the apartment. My stomach still feels like it’s collapsing.

“I hate her,” Yasmine confesses. “They’re all so fucking sus.”

“You did kind of imply something there.”

“You saw it this morning. Ahmed and his parents always know more than they tell you.”

Yasmine takes me to the Halal cart next to the subway station, despite my objections. She orders two platters, and I watch the man chop up the meat and compress everything into the box; it calms me somehow. We take the food and I hold its warmth in my hand. We walk to the station together. Yasmine offers to let me come to her mom’s place with her. I consider going home to investigate more, but I feel afraid of being alone with this mess, incapable of solving it on my own. As we walk down the stairs, I replay the events at the apartment: the box, the bills, everything that doesn’t make sense. I remember that I locked the front door after we entered. We approach the turnstiles. “Did you hear her unlock the door?” I ask Yasmine.

“Bushra Auntie?”

“Yeah. I thought I’d locked the door behind us, but she opened it.”

“Are you sure? I don’t remember. I mean she probably has a key since she’s your neighbor.”

“But then why would she be keying into our apartment like that?”

Yasmine shrugs. She swipes her metrocard then walks to the emergency door and opens it for me.

“Thanks. I’m probably just paranoid.”

“And hungry,” she says.

I glance behind me to make sure there are no cops, then I enter and shut the emergency door behind me. “She wouldn’t just lie to us like that.”

<br>
A black cat greets us at the door of Yasmine’s mother’s apartment. The walls are an earth green, furniture brown and or white. We walk and we take our shoes off. The cat runs circles around us. It claws at my leg, meows, and meows again. Yasmine says he’s territorial, like a dog.

We place the halal platters on the dining table. I empty my wallet, keys, and serviceless phone on the counter. Few know the privilege of weightless pockets. Yasmine gives me a look.

“What?” I ask.

“You remind me of my dad.”

I take that as a negative remark and put the wallet and keys back into my pocket, leaving only the phone. She gives me the wifi password so I could check my messages. I use it to unsubscribe from the emails from Michael’s I keep getting.

The meows are now coming from the end of the kitchen. Yasmine tells me that the cat is why we came. Cat needs kibble every day or it’ll tear the house down (her words). After she says that, I notice tiny holes in the chair cushions and undone fabric in front of the doors. She lets me do the honors. I pour the kibble into the bowl. But the cat just stares at me. I try to encourage it, and it hisses at me. So Yasmine comes and pours a couple kibbles instead of me, and then it starts to eat. Offended, I sit back on the dining room table, while Yasmine splays the halal out like we’re at a flea market. I watch the cat eat.

Fasting captures my body in stages. First comes thirst, before the hunger. Then, by lunchtime, the mouth adapts to saliva, and the emptiness of the stomach starts to take precedence. This period is always anxious, in hunger, thirst, or both. But after that threshold, the body receives a burst of energy. Sensation becomes sharp and intense. I call this third stage the hunter’s instinct, because in my mind the body consumes its energy reserves to continue searching for food and water. (This is pseudoscience.) By the late afternoon, the senses dull. Everything becomes dreamy, and the mind enters a tired trance. Hunger returns, but the body struggles even to evoke it.

It’s one in the afternoon and I’m in the third stage now, feeling restless, though my stomach hurts too. Inside me is energy, motivation to investigate. Now that we got the spare key, my use is fulfilled, and I can go home now, maybe knock on our neighbor’s doors and ask around. I tell Yasmine this when she gives me the plastic fork and knife.

“What?” she says.

“I’m in the third stage. Hunter’s instinct. I should use it before the trances get to me.”

“What the hell are you talking about.”

I grin as diplomacy.

“You clearly need to eat.”

Eating would sustain my energy, but I can’t give up now, not after stages one and two. But it’s more than sunk cost. I’m fasting because it’s the only thing I can do. I am not equipped to handle this. I came home from indecision, but only found crisis, more responsibility. I don’t know how to find my family. Fasting is the last plea I can make. And yet even this action of inaction hurts everything inside of me. Without having suhoor in the morning, my stomach suffers, eating the walls of itself. The pain doesn’t relent, but perhaps I don’t want it to.

Yasmine perks up. “Did you make niyyah?”

“What?”

“Niyyah. Did you make the intention to fast last night before today?”

I keep my mouth shut. She may have found a loophole.

“You realize your fast isn’t valid if you don’t make niyyah. You can’t just wake up and decide you’re fasting like that.”

“God is Merciful,” is all I manage to say.

She stabs my wrist with the plastic fork.

“I need to go anyway. Investigate.”

She looks at me condescendingly. She fixes her posture. “If you’re so confident,” she rips open the halal platter, “Then watch me eat before you leave.”

I accept her challenge. She stuffs her mouth, in an elegant manner. Every few seconds she shoots me a glare. I am not filled with hunger, disgust, or even lust. I just watch her jaw move up and down like a claw machine, with the same indifference with which I’d watch a claw machine. I wonder how the mush looks in her esophagus.

It is during this stalemate that I get an odd text from Samia. I make a face, to which Yasmine asks me what’s wrong.

“It’s my ex,” I say.

She burrows her eyebrows, as if it’s my fault either for being Haram by dating someone or for just not blocking her in the aftermath.

I unlock my phone and read the text out loud. *hey Indy*, I say, mimicking her unthreatening tone. *i just wanted to let you know that I care about you, and I’m here for you if you need anything. please don’t hesitate to reach out.*

“Who’s Indy?” Yasmine says.

“Typo,” I lie. Indy was what I went by in college. From the first orientation introduction, ‘Inzi’ was too intimate for me. Only those who grew up with me knew the thing brown people do where they cut off your name at the end of the first syllable and add an “ee” to it. In the spirit of new beginnings, I introduced myself by my full name, Inzamam, but people had trouble with that. Then a month in, my roommate called me Indy, an Anglophone name with no cultural relevance or emotional register, maybe a microaggression. It was perfect for me.

“Your ex is weird as hell,” Yasmine says.

“I’ve never gotten anything like this before.”

“And why did you tell her your family disappeared?”

“I didn’t!” I say as if I was caught under an open cabinet with chocolate hands. “I swear I didn’t!” I really didn’t.

“How else would she know?”

“I don’t know! It’s weird. I swear I don’t know!” I really don’t.

Then I get a text from Ahmed too. We both stare at the phone like it’s satanic.

*hey Inzi. are you still with Yas? nice of you to help her. anyway i talked to my parents and they said they have an in with the cops and they’ve been working together to figure out what happened. from what it sounded like, they have a good grasp on the case, and probably a lead. but one thing they mentioned-do you have their IDs? not sure why but they mentioned it*
“Useless idiot,” Yasmine says.

I continue. *anyway, look, i wanted to apologize for not telling you everything upfront. i think i’ll leave work early today, we can meet in jackson heights with my parents and talk, maybe make a gameplan. my mom makes an amazing haleem. oh, but don’t invite Yas, please, if you can*

“Whoops,” I say after reading that line.

*oh also. you forgot your toothbrush here.*

Yasmine gets up. “I told him not to call me that.” She cleans up her Halal food. “Look. I gotta go. The station is like an hour away and includes buses and I don’t want to give the cops a reason to cancel my appointment.”

“Okay. I can go home then and meet with Ahmed. Do some field work, ask the neighbors, etcetera.”

She stops. “Inzi, I’m not gonna stop you, but I’m not asking my mom what happened to your family unless you sit your ass back down and eat first.”

I am dumbfounded.

“You heard me. Sit it back down and eat. You can lock the door behind you when you leave.”

“But I am scared to be left with this cat that hates me.”

“You’ll be fine. Bye, Inzi. I’ll text or call you after. Keep your phone with you.”

I hear the front door close. The cat and I make awkward eye contact. I wander around the kitchen, then text Ahmed I can meet him in an hour, after I eat. I stare at the Halal food. Yasmine is right. Fasting isn’t doing anything but making me more anxious and hungry. I pick up the plastic fork. But then the cat starts meowing at me.

“What do you want?” I ask.

The cat leads me to the front. It meows at the door, claws at it once or twice.

“She’s gone, man. She’ll be back though.” I make some meaningless gesture with my hands to try to communicate that to her. I wonder if cats can be taught sign language.

I start to go back to the food, but the cat meows again.

“Okay. Look. She’s gone. Look. You want to see?” I open the door and gesture to the empty hallway.

The cat runs out. It disappears into the stairs.

“Shit,” I say, fork still in my hand. “Shit.” I stab my scalp one, two, three times.

<br>
The streets are mired with the stench of blood and runaway cats. Corona is ugly in the late afternoon. The crowded streets bear sidewalks too tiny, the lack of lighting under the waning sun starts to be exposed. I am haggard. My cheeks feel heavy. My throat is dry and my ankles are sore. I pass too many warehouses chasing a cat I lost track of an hour ago. When it ran away, the front door was left open by a moving company. And the floor was empty. Nothing under the mailboxes or stairs. I ran out the door. I walked through each block, stopped every stranger I passed, asked if they saw a black cat pass them recently.

I put myself in the cat’s shoes. I even squatted down to its height. This took me to the park, where an elderly gentleman told me he saw a black cat run under its bench and then towards National Street where the mosque was.

We’re dealing with a devout kitty, I said to myself.

The masjid was closed. National Street became Corona Avenue. I looped around through 102nd and 104th. The only lead I had expired. No one had seen anything. My body glitched; it split into the same time yesterday, chasing the fake lead for Miguel, ending in nothing but a nap. I was so tired. What I was doing here in Corona, Queens, far from my halal food, with no water since last night? The walls of my stomach felt like they’d collapse into themselves. I wanted to crawl under the double parked cars like a cat, lay my body to rest there, and die.

Somehow I ended up in Queens Center, putting me in Elmhurst now, at least a mile away. Of course the cat would not be there. I went inside anyway.

I passed a cosmetics store, a Kay’s, a glasses store, then a Vietnamese beauty shop. I stopped at the window of the beauty shop and peeked in. Only one customer was inside, a Vietnamese woman of indiscernible age having her eyebrows threaded by a teenager, probably the store owner’s daughter or niece. The woman laid down almost into the girl’s lap, her eyes closed, their backs to me. The girl’s shoulders twitched occasionally as she plucked the hairs with the thread. Sometimes her hair advanced too far forward and she had to fling her head backwards and behind her ears. I wondered where her mother and father were. If they were in the store, to come soon in and watch, or if they left her to run the shop alone.

I remember turning sixteen. I remember, the morning after, my father taking me to the car to teach me how to drive. It was a time of distance between us. I paid no attention at first. But when he started showing me all the buttons and levers, I was injected with joy, even awe. The car’s handbrake, its windshield wipers and side mirrors became a secret language we then shared. We drove together. Sometimes I held the steering wheel while he controlled the gas and the brake. In that car, only in that car, I could access him.

Then he put me behind the wheel, and instantly I felt the sharp feeling of loss. I did not understand why when he touched my hand on the gear selector that it felt cold and moist, or how despite the knowledge I was given and the care I had received, I felt hollow, porous, and sparse. But I kept at it. I learned quickly. Within two weeks, I was driving down 34th Avenue. I finally understood the fog that had descended on me that February when Abu told me I was ready to drive alone. He said I would take the test and could now do chores and pick my sister up from school. No longer would I come with him when he picked up dinner or shopped for groceries. I would be doing that myself. I’d gained knowledge, brief time, even an understanding with him. But I lost him himself. I lost in this process what bound me to my parents, or bound my parents towards me. I was once excited by growing, until I learned that age was independence, that independence was separation, and I could not stop it from taking place. I passed the test and we got a second car. I missed Abu in the passenger seat.

I missed Abu in the passenger seat. I left Queens Center and went back to Corona. I want my family back. I approach Yasmine’s building, praying they’re there somehow, waiting for me. I wait at the front door. The movers carry out a mattress. I walk in after them.

I run up the stairs two steps at a time and crash into the apartment, but no one is there. Everywhere, always, everything is empty. I check the floorboards, the bathroom and the closets, as if they’re hiding to surprise me. I can still smell the Halal food. There are no signs of the cat. I come back to the living room and collapse in front of the sofa. I cry into my hands, out of hunger, out of shame, out of despair. I imagine telling Yasmine her mom’s cat is gone when she comes back, watching her face turn to disbelief. How is it that you always make everything worse? she says. You think your self-pity excuses your self-centeredness, but it doesn’t. You can’t just do whatever you want—leave home, leave relationships, come back when you feel lonely—and expect people to be okay with that, or even just okay. Then she crosses her arms and says, Maybe you deserve this, Inzamam.

My head starts to clear, then something touches my arm. I look up and wipe the water off my face. It’s a black cat, meowing at me. He rubs against my shoulders and licks my face. Now more tears come. And I’m laughing through them now. I’m thinking of how I have managed to do nothing the last three days, how instead, everything has been done unto me. I have control over nothing, and yet I’ve felt and caused so much pain. I am an observer, a guilty bystander; I walk in circles, consumed by inaction, condemned to be alone.

I sniffle and pet the cat. I walk to the kitchen to fill up its water and open the Halal food. But then my phone screen flashes on, displaying a text from Ahmed. I read it.

*hey man, where are you? i’m at home now but my mom said you went out. we tried checking your apartment but you weren’t there*

I look at my notifications and see seven missed calls, not from him, but from Yasmine, with five texts underneath.

*Inzi*, it says.

*Inzi*

*Please pick up.*

*Inzi*

*My mom said your family was abducted by ICE*
